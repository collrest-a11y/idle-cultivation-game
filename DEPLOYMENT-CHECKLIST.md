# Deployment Checklist - Error Handling System

## Pre-Deployment Validation ✅

- [x] **System Validation**: All validation tests pass (100% success rate)
- [x] **File Structure**: All 16 required files present and integrated
- [x] **Component Integration**: All scripts properly loaded in index.html
- [x] **Performance**: System size (100.51 KB) and load time (< 1ms) within limits
- [x] **Documentation**: Complete technical documentation available
- [x] **Build System**: Webpack configuration ready for production builds

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Quick Production Deployment
```bash
# Validate system
node scripts/run-validation.cjs

# Deploy to production
node scripts/deploy-error-system.js deploy production

# Verify deployment
node scripts/deploy-error-system.js health-check
```

### Option 2: Phased Rollout (Recommended)
```bash
# Start canary deployment (5% users)
node migration/error-system-rollout.js start canary

# Expand to early adopters (25% users) 
node migration/error-system-rollout.js start early

# Expand to majority (75% users)
node migration/error-system-rollout.js start majority

# Complete rollout (100% users)
node migration/error-system-rollout.js start complete
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Commands
```bash
# Automatic rollback (if monitoring detects issues)
node scripts/deploy-error-system.js rollback "Issue description"

# Manual rollout rollback
node migration/error-system-rollout.js rollback "Issue description"
```

## Production Monitoring

After deployment, monitor these key metrics:
- Error processing latency (target: < 10ms)
- Memory usage (target: < 100MB)
- System health checks (every 30 seconds)
- Error rates and recovery success

## Final Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
