```bash
# Automatically triggered by CI/CD pipeline
scripts/deployment/calculate-confidence.js
```

**Key Validations:**
- Code quality and linting
- Unit test execution (target: 100% pass rate)
- Integration test suite (target: 95%+ pass rate)
- Performance baseline validation
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Deployment confidence scoring (threshold: 85%)

**Success Criteria:**
- Confidence score ≥ 85%
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks met
- All integration tests passing

#### Phase 2: Cross-System Integration Validation (10-15 minutes)
```bash
# Automated cross-system testing
scripts/testing/regression-protection-suite.js
```

**Key Validations:**
- Cross-system data flow validation
- Event propagation testing across all 12 systems
- Save/load integration verification
- Economic system validation
- Performance integration testing under load

**Success Criteria:**
- All 12 MMORPG systems validated
- Cross-system latency <50ms
- Data integrity maintained across all transactions
- No critical regressions detected

#### Phase 3: Production Readiness Validation (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# Production environment validation
scripts/deployment/validate-production-config.js
```

**Key Validations:**
- Infrastructure resource availability
- Database connectivity and migration readiness
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Environment variable validation
- Backup and recovery systems

**Success Criteria:**
- All infrastructure checks passing
- Environment properly configured

#### Phase 4: Staging Deployment (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
scripts/deployment/deploy-staging.js
```

**Process:**
1. Deploy application to staging environment
2. Execute post-deployment smoke tests
3. Validate performance under simulated load
4. Verify integration health

#### Phase 5: Production Deployment (10-15 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy to production (if staging validation passes)
scripts/deployment/deploy-production.js
```

**Process:**
1. Create pre-deployment backup
2. Deploy application with zero-downtime strategy
3. Execute immediate post-deployment validation
4. Monitor system health for 15 minutes
5. Update monitoring dashboards

### Manual Deployment Steps (Emergency Use Only)

If automated deployment fails, follow these manual steps:

1. **Create Safety Backup**
   ```bash
   scripts/deployment/backup-production.js
   ```

2. **Validate Deployment Package**
   ```bash
   scripts/deployment/validate-deployment-package.js [version]
   ```

3. **Execute Deployment**
   ```bash
   scripts/deployment/manual-deploy.js [version]
   ```

4. **Validate Deployment**
   ```bash
   scripts/deployment/post-deployment-validation.js
   ```

- [ ] Game systems health scores >90%
- [ ] Error rate <1%
- [ ] Frame rate >45fps (target: 60fps)

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] Navigate to production URL and verify game loads
- [ ] Test player registration/login flow
- [ ] Verify cultivation system progression
- [ ] Test save/load functionality
- [ ] Confirm cross-system integrations working
- [ ] Check monitoring dashboards for anomalies

### Extended Validation (15-60 minutes)

#### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor response times for sustained period
- [ ] Validate frame rate stability under load
- [ ] Check memory usage patterns
- [ ] Verify error rates remain low

#### User Experience Validation
- [ ] Monitor player feedback channels
- [ ] Check support ticket volume
- [ ] Validate key user journeys
- [ ] Confirm feature functionality

### 24-Hour Monitoring

#### Continuous Monitoring Points

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers

The system automatically initiates rollback if:
- Post-deployment validation fails
- Error rate exceeds 5%
- Response time degradation >100%
- Frame rate drops below 30fps
- Critical system failure detected

### Manual Rollback Process

#### Emergency Rollback (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# Execute immediate rollback to last known good version
scripts/deployment/rollback-production.js
```

**Process:**
1. Automated backup creation
2. Service shutdown (brief downtime)
3. Application file restoration
4. Configuration restoration
5. Service restart
6. Health validation

#### Validated Rollback (10-15 minutes)
```bash
# Execute rollback with full validation
scripts/deployment/rollback-production.js --validate
```

**Additional Steps:**
- Pre-rollback system state capture
- Database rollback (if applicable)
- Complete post-rollback validation
- Monitoring configuration update

### Rollback Validation

After rollback completion:
- [ ] All services healthy
- [ ] Performance metrics restored
- [ ] User functionality verified
- [ ] Monitoring alerts cleared
- [ ] Incident documentation completed
