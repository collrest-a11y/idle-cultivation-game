### Key Features

1. **Project Management Commands**
   - `/pm:init` - Initialize the system
   - `/pm:prd-new <feature>` - Create feature requirements
   - `/pm:epic-oneshot <feature>` - Convert to GitHub issues
   - `/pm:balance-check` - Analyze game balance
   - `/pm:system-design <system>` - Design new systems

2. **Cultivation Game Specific Tools**
   - Game balance analysis for progression systems
   - Cultivation-themed system design templates
   - Player progression bottleneck identification
   - Wuxia/Xianxia authenticity guidelines

3. **GitHub Integration**
   - Automatic issue creation from epics
   - Parallel task execution tracking
   - Sub-issue support for complex features
   - Progress synchronization

## How to Use

### Starting a New Feature

1. **Create Requirements**
   ```
   /pm:prd-new enhanced-combat-system
   ```

2. **Convert to Epic**
   ```
   /pm:prd-parse enhanced-combat-system
   ```

3. **Create GitHub Issues**
   ```
   /pm:epic-oneshot enhanced-combat-system
   ```

4. **Start Development**
   ```
   /pm:issue-start <issue-number>
   ```

### Game-Specific Workflows

1. **Balance Analysis**
   ```
   /pm:balance-check cultivation
   /pm:progression-audit early-game
   ```

2. **System Design**
   ```
   /pm:system-design artifact-system
   /pm:system-design formation-mechanics
   ```

3. **Context Updates**
   ```
   /context:create
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- No partial implementations
- Test coverage for all functions
- Consistent naming conventions
- Single responsibility principle
- Performance optimization for idle gameplay

### Game Design Principles
- Always-progressing idle mechanics
- Authentic wuxia/xianxia themes
- Meaningful player choices
- Balanced progression curves
- Social collaboration features

### Quality Assurance
- Balance validation testing
- Save/load integrity checks
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Offline behavior testing

## Next Steps

1. **Explore Commands**: Try `/pm:prd-new test-feature` to create your first PRD
2. **Review Context**: Check `.claude/context/project-overview.md` for current project state
3. **Create Features**: Use the system to plan and implement new cultivation systems
4. **Monitor Balance**: Regular balance checks as you add new progression elements

## Benefits

- **Structured Development**: Clear requirements → epic → tasks workflow
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- **Quality Focus**: Built-in balance and progression analysis
- **Game-Specific**: Tailored for idle cultivation game development
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless issue tracking and progress monitoring

The system is now ready for use. All commands are available through Claude Code and will help maintain development quality while scaling the cultivation game efficiently.
