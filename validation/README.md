# Error Detection System

## Overview

This error detection system provides comprehensive, multi-layered error capture that goes beyond simple console error monitoring. It's designed to catch functional failures, UI issues, performance problems, and other bugs that traditional validation might miss.

## Components

### 1. ErrorDetector (`error-detector.js`)
The core error detection engine that monitors:
- **Console errors and warnings** - Captures console.error, console.warn messages
- **Page errors** - JavaScript exceptions and unhandled errors
- **Unhandled Promise rejections** - Async operation failures
- **Network failures** - Failed requests, HTTP error responses
- **Performance issues** - Memory pressure, low FPS, lag spikes
- **UI validation** - Missing elements, zero-dimension elements, overlapping controls
- **Functional errors** - Button states, workflow failures

### 2. ErrorAggregator (`error-aggregator.js`)
Collects and analyzes errors from multiple detectors:
- **Error prioritization** - Sorts by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- **Pattern analysis** - Identifies recurring error patterns
- **Component analysis** - Groups errors by affected components
- **Recommendations** - Generates actionable improvement suggestions
- **Quality assessment** - Evaluates error detection completeness and accuracy

### 3. ErrorReporter (`error-reporter.js`)
Generates comprehensive reports in multiple formats:
- **Summary reports** - Quick overview with critical issues
- **Technical reports** - Detailed analysis for developers
- **Functional reports** - Focus on component-specific failures
- **HTML reports** - Interactive browser-viewable reports
- **Root cause analysis** - Identifies likely causes of issues

## Key Features

### Multi-Layer Error Capture
Unlike systems that only check console errors, this system captures:
- Functional failures (like the character creation button bug)
- UI visibility and interaction issues
- Performance degradation
- Network connectivity problems
- Memory leaks and resource issues

### Error Context
Every error includes comprehensive context:
- Timestamp and location
- User actions that led to the error
- Component and DOM state
- Performance metrics
- Browser and environment details

### Deduplication
Prevents spam from repeated errors by:
- Time-based deduplication (5-second window)
- Pattern recognition for similar errors
- Frequency analysis for recurring issues

### Severity Classification
Automatic categorization:
- **CRITICAL**: Game-breaking errors that prevent normal operation
- **HIGH**: Feature failures that impact core functionality
- **MEDIUM**: UX issues that degrade user experience
- **LOW**: Minor warnings and informational messages

## Character Creation Bug Detection

This system would catch the character creation bug through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Functional Error Detection**: Monitors button state and detects when all selections are made but button remains disabled
2. **UI Monitoring**: Checks for elements that should be interactive but aren't
3. **Workflow Validation**: Verifies that UI transitions work as expected
4. **Event Handling**: Captures JavaScript errors in event handlers

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
import { ErrorDetector } from './error-detector.js';
import { ErrorAggregator } from './error-aggregator.js';
import { ErrorReporter } from './error-reporter.js';

const detector = new ErrorDetector();
const aggregator = new ErrorAggregator();
const reporter = new ErrorReporter();

await detector.initialize(page);
aggregator.addDetector(detector);

// Run tests...
const errors = await aggregator.collectAllErrors();
const report = reporter.generateReport(aggregator.generateReport());
```

### Integration with Tests
```javascript
import { runErrorDetection } from './run-error-detection.js';

const results = await runErrorDetection(page);
console.log(`Found ${results.summary.total} errors`);
console.log(`Critical issues: ${results.summary.critical}`);
```

### Custom Error Capture
```javascript
// Capture functional errors directly
detector.captureFunctionalError({
  type: 'functional-error',
  severity: 'CRITICAL',
  component: 'character-creation',
  issue: 'Button state inconsistency',
  expectedState: 'enabled',
  actualState: 'disabled'
});
```

## Integration Notes

This error detection system is designed to integrate with:
- Playwright test automation
- Automated fix systems
- CI/CD validation pipelines
- Real-time monitoring dashboards

The system provides the foundation for automated error detection that can catch complex functional bugs that would otherwise require manual testing to discover.

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Catches errors that console-only monitoring misses
2. **Early Detection**: Identifies issues during development, not production
3. **Contextual Information**: Provides actionable details for debugging
4. **Automated Analysis**: Reduces manual effort in error triage
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies systemic issues and trends
6. **Quality Metrics**: Quantifies application reliability and stability

This system transforms error detection from reactive bug hunting to proactive quality assurance.
