# PRD: Automated Validation & Fix Loop System

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines an automated quality assurance system that continuously validates, identifies, and fixes all errors in the Idle Cultivation Game codebase. The system will use Playwright for real browser testing, MCP for AI-assisted fixes, and iterative loops to achieve 100% error-free production code. This addresses the critical issue discovered where "validation passed" messages were misleading while the game's character creation was completely broken.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Manual validation tests report "PASSED" while critical features are broken
- Character creation flow is non-functional despite "zero errors" being reported
- Console-based validation misses real user interaction issues
- No automated fix mechanism for discovered problems
- False confidence from misleading test results

### Why This Is Critical Now
1. **Game is Unplayable**: Players cannot create characters and start the game
2. **False Security**: Current tests give false confidence while hiding critical bugs
3. **Manual Fixes Are Slow**: Each bug requires manual investigation and fixing
4. **No Regression Prevention**: Fixed issues can reappear without detection
5. **Production Readiness**: Cannot deploy with confidence

## User Stories

### Primary: Game Developer
**Story**: As a game developer, I need an automated system that finds and fixes all bugs so that I can deploy with confidence.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System detects 100% of functional bugs
- Automatic fixes are generated and validated
- I receive detailed reports of what was fixed
- Rollback is available if fixes cause issues
- No false positives in error detection

### Secondary: QA Engineer
**Story**: As a QA engineer, I need comprehensive validation that tests real user flows so that I can certify the game is production-ready.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All user journeys are automatically tested
