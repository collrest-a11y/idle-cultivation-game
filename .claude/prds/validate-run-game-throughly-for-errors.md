# PRD: Validate Run Game Thoroughly for Errors

## Executive Summary

Develop a zero-tolerance comprehensive validation and testing framework for the Idle Cultivation Game that ensures absolute error-free execution across all systems. This includes live game testing with actual browser validation, extended idle session performance testing (24+ hours), automated testing suites, manual validation procedures, and production-ready code quality assurance. Every line of code must be tested, every user interaction validated, and every expected output verified by actually running the game.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
The game currently experiences various runtime errors that prevent players from accessing and enjoying the full game experience. Recent issues include:
- Blank page loads due to ViewIntegration failures
- JavaScript runtime errors in core systems
- Module initialization dependency conflicts
- UI component failures (notification systems, view transitions)
- Save/load data corruption potential
- Cross-browser compatibility issues

### Why is this important now?
- **Zero Error Tolerance**: Idle games must run flawlessly for days/weeks without intervention - any error is unacceptable
- **Production Quality**: Every line of code must meet production standards with full test coverage
- **Extended Session Reliability**: Players expect 24+ hour idle sessions without crashes, memory leaks, or performance degradation
- **Live Validation Required**: All testing must include actual browser execution to verify expected outputs
- **Player Trust**: In idle games, players invest significant time - any data loss or malfunction breaks trust permanently

## User Stories
