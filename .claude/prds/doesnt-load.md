# PRD: doesnt-load

## Executive Summary

Implement a production-ready, fully validated loading system that guarantees the game loads successfully every time. This includes comprehensive error handling, automated testing with Playwright MCP, and real-time error monitoring that feeds back into our development workflow.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
The game fails to load due to JavaScript errors, module initialization issues, and lack of proper error recovery. We need ACTUAL WORKING CODE that:
1. Fixes all current loading errors
2. Prevents future loading failures
3. Automatically validates fixes with Playwright
4. Provides real-time error feedback for immediate fixes

### Why is this important now?
- Game is currently broken - players can't even start
- We have the error collection system but need to USE it
- Manual testing is not catching these issues
- Need automated validation pipeline

## User Stories

### Developer Story - Brendan
- I need the game to load 100% reliably
- I want automated tests that catch loading issues before deployment
- I need real-time error reporting that I can act on immediately
- I want production-ready code, not prototypes or simulations

### Player Story - End User
- Game must load within 3 seconds
- If something breaks, it should self-heal
- Clear feedback on loading progress
- Never lose game progress due to loading issues

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements - PRODUCTION CODE

**Immediate Fixes**
- FR1: Fix all current JavaScript errors (typos, missing methods, undefined references)
- FR2: Validate every module loads correctly before proceeding
- FR3: Implement dependency graph for correct loading order
- FR4: Add pre-flight checks for browser compatibility

**Error Prevention System**
- FR5: Static code analysis before loading modules
- FR6: Runtime type checking for critical paths
- FR7: Module integrity verification (checksums)
- FR8: Automatic fallback to cached versions

**Real-Time Error Handling**
- FR9: Connect error collector to game automatically
- FR10: Capture ALL errors with full context
- FR11: Auto-generate fix suggestions using error patterns

- FR13: Playwright tests for every loading scenario
- FR14: Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- FR15: Mobile browser testing via Playwright
- FR16: Performance regression testing
- FR17: Save data compatibility testing

**Recovery Mechanisms**
- FR18: Automatic module reloading on failure

- FR20: State preservation during recovery
- FR21: One-click fix application from error reports

**Production Monitoring**
- FR22: Real-time dashboard showing loading metrics
- FR23: Automated alerts for loading failures
- FR24: Error pattern detection and alerting

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- NFR1: Load time <3 seconds on 3G connection
- NFR2: Zero blocking JavaScript errors
- NFR3: Memory usage <100MB during load
- NFR4: CPU usage <50% during initialization

**Reliability**
- NFR5: 100% loading success rate (with recovery)
- NFR6: Automated rollback on critical failures
- NFR7: Zero data corruption during recovery
- NFR8: Graceful handling of network interruptions

**Testing**
- NFR9: 100% code coverage for loading system
- NFR10: Automated testing on every code change
- NFR11: Visual regression testing for loading UI
- NFR12: Load testing for 1000+ concurrent users

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- Zero loading failures in production
- Automated detection and fix of any new issues
- Complete Playwright test suite passing
- Real-time error monitoring operational

### Validation Requirements
- All Playwright MCP tests must pass
- Cross-browser compatibility verified

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Always validate with Playwright MCP** - No manual testing only
2. **Never simplify** - Build complete production systems
3. **Parallel execution** - Use multiple work streams
4. **GitHub sync** - Every task creates an issue
5. **Real code only** - No simulations or prototypes
6. **Immediate testing** - Validate as we build
7. **Error feedback loop** - Use error collector for real-time fixes
