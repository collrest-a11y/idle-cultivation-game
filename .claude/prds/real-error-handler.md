# PRD: Real Error Handler

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive, production-ready error handling system that provides real-time error detection, automatic recovery mechanisms, and detailed monitoring for the idle cultivation game. This system will ensure 99.9% uptime through intelligent error recovery, fallback strategies, and self-healing capabilities. All implementations must be actual working code, not simulations or theoretical designs.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
- Game crashes without recovery, losing player progress
- No centralized error handling leading to inconsistent error management
- Silent failures that corrupt game state
- No visibility into production errors
- Manual intervention required for all error recovery

### Why Now?
- Player retention dropping due to crashes (estimated 15% loss)
- Support tickets increasing 3x due to error-related issues
- Development velocity slowed by debugging production issues
- Competitive games have robust error handling setting user expectations

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

#### 1. Active Player
**Story**: As an active player, I want the game to recover automatically from errors so that I don't lose my progress or have to refresh the page.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Errors are caught before crashing the game
- Game state is preserved through errors
- Recovery happens within 2 seconds
- Clear feedback when recovery is in progress

#### 2. Idle Player
**Story**: As an idle player, I want the game to continue running even if errors occur while I'm away, so my progression continues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Game continues idle calculations after recovery
- No progress lost during error recovery
- Offline progression calculated correctly after recovery

#### 3. Developer
**Story**: As a developer, I want detailed error logs and recovery metrics so I can fix root causes and improve the system.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All errors logged with stack traces
- Recovery attempts tracked with success rates
- Performance metrics available in dashboard
- Ability to replay error scenarios

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Error Handling
1. **Global Error Capture**
   - Window.onerror handler implementation
   - Promise rejection handling
   - Event listener error capture
   - Module loading error detection

2. **Error Classification**
   - Automatic categorization by type (network, state, UI, etc.)
   - Severity levels (critical, major, minor, warning)
   - Pattern recognition for known issues
   - Error fingerprinting for deduplication

3. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
   - State rollback to last valid checkpoint
   - Graceful degradation for non-critical features
   - Module hot-reloading for recoverable errors

4. **Monitoring & Reporting**
   - Real-time error dashboard
   - Error rate tracking and alerting
   - Recovery success metrics
   - Performance impact measurement
   - Trend analysis and predictions

5. **User Communication**
   - Non-intrusive error notifications
   - Recovery progress indicators
   - Option to report persistent issues
   - Clear action items for unrecoverable errors

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Error detection: <10ms overhead
- Recovery initiation: <100ms
- Full recovery: <2 seconds for 95% of cases
- Memory usage: <5MB for error tracking
- CPU impact: <2% during normal operation

#### Reliability
- 99.9% error capture rate
- 85% automatic recovery success rate
- Zero data loss for saved game states
- Fault tolerance for error handler itself

#### Security
- No sensitive data in error logs
- Sanitized error messages to users
- Protected against error-based DOS attacks
- Secure error reporting endpoint

#### Scalability
- Handle 1000+ errors/minute without degradation
- Automatic log rotation and cleanup
- Efficient storage of error history
- Batched error reporting to reduce network calls

## Success Criteria

### Key Metrics
1. **Error Recovery Rate**: >85% of errors automatically recovered
2. **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: <2 seconds
3. **User Impact**: <5% of sessions experience visible errors
4. **Performance**: <10ms overhead on page load
5. **Data Integrity**: 100% game state preservation

### Business Outcomes
- 50% reduction in error-related support tickets within 30 days
- 10% improvement in player retention due to stability
- 75% reduction in developer debugging time
- 90% reduction in game-breaking bugs reaching production

### Implementation Requirements
- **ACTUAL FILE CREATION**: All files must be created using Write/MultiEdit tools
- **PRODUCTION CODE**: No mock implementations or stubs
- **REAL TESTING**: Playwright MCP must validate in actual browser
- **WORKING FEATURES**: Every component must be functional and integrated
- **VERIFIABLE**: Each file must be readable with Read tool and executable

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must work in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Cannot exceed 10MB total bundle size
- Must integrate with existing game architecture
- Cannot break existing save system
- Must be implemented within 2 week timeline

### Assumptions
- Players have stable internet for error reporting
- Browser supports modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Local storage available for error logs
- Game has stable baseline without critical bugs
- Development environment has Playwright MCP access

## Out of Scope

- Mobile app error handling (web only for now)
- Backend/server error handling
- Third-party service integration monitoring
- Automated bug fixing (only recovery)
- Historical error analysis beyond 30 days
- Multi-language error messages

## Dependencies

- Playwright MCP for testing
- Network connection for error reporting

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing SaveManager for state preservation
- EventManager for error event propagation
- ModuleManager for hot-reloading
- GameState for checkpoint creation

### Prerequisite Work

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Error handler itself fails
- **Mitigation**: Implement self-healing with fallback to minimal handler

- **Risk**: Performance degradation
- **Mitigation**: Implement sampling and throttling for high-volume errors

- **Risk**: Memory leaks from error tracking
- **Mitigation**: Automatic cleanup and rotation of error logs

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Users disable due to notifications
- **Mitigation**: Make notifications subtle and valuable

- **Risk**: Over-reliance on automatic recovery
- **Mitigation**: Still fix root causes, recovery is safety net

Each implementation task must:
1. Create actual files with complete code
2. Be tested with real browser using Playwright MCP
3. Include performance benchmarks
4. Have error injection tests
