# PRD: Blank-Page Fix

## Executive Summary
The idle cultivation game frequently fails to load, showing either a blank page or critical JavaScript errors that prevent gameplay. This PRD addresses the root causes of these failures and establishes a robust loading system that ensures the game always reaches a playable state, even when individual systems fail.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Players cannot play the game due to critical loading failures that result in:
- Completely blank pages with no content
- JavaScript errors that halt execution
- Partial loading where UI appears but is non-functional
- Character creation that doesn't transition to main game
- Module loading failures that cascade into total failure

### Why is this important now?
- **100% blocking issue** - No one can play the game when it fails to load
- **First impression killer** - New players immediately abandon a blank/broken game
- **Development blocker** - Can't test or develop features on a non-functional base
- **Accumulating technical debt** - Each new feature adds more potential failure points

## User Stories

### Primary User: Player attempting to start the game
**As a** player
**I want** the game to load successfully every time
**So that** I can play without technical barriers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Game loads within 5 seconds on modern browsers
- Shows loading progress indicator
- Displays meaningful error messages if something fails
- Always reaches a playable state (even if degraded)

### Secondary User: Developer testing changes
**As a** developer
**I want** clear error messages and graceful degradation
**So that** I can identify and fix issues quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Console shows structured error logs
- Failed modules don't crash entire game
- Can reload/retry failed components
- Debug mode shows system status

### Tertiary User: Player with corrupted save
**As a** player with corrupted data
**I want** the game to detect and recover from bad states
**So that** I don't lose everything due to a bug

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detects corrupted save data
- Offers recovery options
- Can start fresh if needed
- Preserves what data can be salvaged

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Loading System
1. **Robust Module Loader**
   - Implement try-catch for all module initializations
   - Support optional vs required modules
   - Retry mechanism for failed loads
   - Timeout protection for hanging operations

2. **Progressive Loading**
   - Load critical systems first (core game state, save manager)
   - Load UI systems second (ensure something visible)
   - Load gameplay systems last (can be async)
   - Show loading progress to user

3. **Error Boundary System**
   - Catch all uncaught errors
   - Prevent error cascade
   - Log errors with context
   - Attempt recovery strategies

4. **Fallback Rendering**
   - Basic HTML fallback if JavaScript fails
   - Minimal game mode if modules fail
   - "Safe mode" with reduced features
   - Clear user communication about degraded state

5. **State Validation**
   - Validate save data before loading
   - Validate DOM requirements
   - Check browser compatibility
   - Verify required assets exist

#### Character Creation Fix
1. **Event System Isolation**
   - Character creation independent of game modules
   - Simple, bulletproof event handling
   - Direct DOM manipulation fallback
   - Clear transition to main game

2. **Polling-based State Detection**
   - Monitor button selections without complex events
   - Enable/disable UI based on state
   - Work regardless of module load order

#### Module System Improvements
1. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Clear dependency graph
   - Load modules in correct order
   - Handle circular dependencies
   - Support lazy loading

2. **Module Health Checks**
   - Each module reports health status
   - Automated recovery attempts
   - Graceful degradation paths
   - Status dashboard for debugging

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Initial load time < 3 seconds
- Time to interactive < 5 seconds
- Memory usage < 100MB initial
- Works on 2+ year old devices

#### Reliability
- 99.9% successful load rate
- Graceful handling of all error types
- Automatic recovery from transient failures
- No data loss on crashes

#### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge (last 2 versions)
- Firefox (last 2 versions)
- Safari (last 2 versions)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome)
- File:// protocol support

#### Developer Experience
- Clear error messages
- Structured logging
- Debug utilities
- Testing helpers

## Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics
- **Load Success Rate**: >99% of attempts result in playable game
- **Time to Playable**: <5 seconds on average
- **Error Recovery Rate**: >90% of errors handled gracefully
- **User Retention**: <1% abandonment due to technical issues

### Secondary Metrics
- **Module Load Time**: Each module <500ms
- **Error Report Quality**: 100% of errors include actionable context
- **Recovery Time**: <2 seconds for automatic recovery
- **Debug Mode Overhead**: <10% performance impact

### Testing Verification
- Loads successfully from file:// protocol
- Loads successfully from http://localhost
- Loads successfully from production URL
- Loads successfully with corrupted localStorage
- Loads successfully with slow network
- Loads successfully with ad blockers
- Loads successfully on mobile devices

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing save format
- Cannot require server-side components
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Must work offline

### Resource Constraints
- Single developer implementation
- No external dependencies allowed
- Must use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Limited testing device access

### Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers (2020+)
- Users have stable localStorage access
- Users have at least 100MB free memory
- Network assets can be cached

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly NOT part of this fix:
- Complete game rewrite
- New UI framework adoption
- Server-side save system
- Automated error reporting to server
- Performance optimizations beyond loading
- New game features
- Mobile app versions
- Multiplayer functionality

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Access to all error logs and reports
- Understanding of current module structure
- List of all critical vs optional features
- Current browser compatibility requirements

### External Dependencies
- Browser localStorage API
- Browser console API
- File system access (for file:// protocol)
- DOM manipulation APIs

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing module system architecture
- Current save/load system
- Event manager implementation
- UI component structure

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Diagnosis (Immediate)
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Identify all failure points
- Document module dependencies
- Create error catalog

### Phase 2: Critical Fixes (Priority 1)
- Fix module loading order
- Add error boundaries
- Fix character creation flow
- Implement basic recovery

### Phase 3: Robustness (Priority 2)
- Add progressive loading
- Implement fallback modes
- Add health checks
- Create debug dashboard

### Phase 4: Polish (Priority 3)
- Optimize load times
- Improve error messages
- Add user-friendly recovery
- Document troubleshooting

## Risk Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Breaking existing saves** - Mitigate with backward compatibility layer
2. **Performance regression** - Mitigate with performance budget
3. **Browser incompatibility** - Mitigate with feature detection
4. **Increased complexity** - Mitigate with comprehensive documentation

## Rollback Plan

If the fix causes new issues:
1. Revert to previous version immediately
2. Preserve error logs for analysis
3. Implement fixes behind feature flag
4. Gradual rollout with monitoring

## Success Communication

When complete:
- Show "Game Health: âœ… All Systems Operational" in UI
- Log successful initialization to console
- Display version and load time in debug mode
- Provide troubleshooting guide for remaining edge cases
