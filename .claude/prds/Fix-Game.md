# PRD: Fix-Game

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a comprehensive solution to fix all critical game-breaking issues in the Idle Cultivation game. The game currently fails to load properly, has multiple JavaScript errors, and provides a poor user experience with blank screens and non-functional features. This initiative will implement robust error handling, proper module initialization, and thorough validation to ensure the game runs reliably across all environments (file://, localhost, production).

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
The Idle Cultivation game is currently unplayable due to cascading failures during initialization:
- Module loading fails with "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- Character creation doesn't work reliably
- UI components fail to render properly
- Error recovery mechanisms don't activate correctly
- Previous "fixes" were merged without proper validation

### Why is this important now?
- Users cannot play the game at all - complete product failure
- Technical debt from rushed fixes is compounding
- Trust in the development process has been damaged
- Every attempted fix introduces new issues due to lack of testing

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**1. New Player**
- Wants to start playing immediately
- Expects game to load without technical knowledge
- Needs clear feedback if something goes wrong

**2. Returning Player**
- Has existing save data
- Expects game state to persist
- Needs recovery if save is corrupted

**3. Developer**
- Needs reliable local development environment
- Requires clear error messages for debugging
- Expects comprehensive test coverage

### Detailed User Journeys

**New Player Journey:**
1. Opens index.html in browser
2. Sees loading screen with progress
3. Character creation appears and works on first try
4. Game starts successfully
5. Can play without errors

**Returning Player Journey:**
1. Opens game URL
2. Save data loads automatically
3. Returns to previous game state
4. Continues playing seamlessly

**Developer Journey:**
1. Clones repository
2. Opens index.html locally
3. Game loads in development mode
4. Can modify code and see changes
5. Has tools to debug issues

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Blank screen with no feedback
- Character creation failing silently
- Module loading errors preventing gameplay
- Save corruption causing permanent failures
- No recovery path when things go wrong

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core System Fixes:**

- Full gameplay simulation testing

**Complete Gameplay Validation:**
- Character creation through to end-game
- All cultivation stages and breakthroughs

- Shop transactions (buying/selling)
- CP (Cultivation Points) calculations and increases
- Realm progression mechanics
- Resource generation and consumption

- Save/load at every game stage
- UI updates for all game states

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Initial load time < 3 seconds
- Character creation response < 100ms
- Module loading timeout 30 seconds max
- Memory usage < 100MB baseline

**Reliability:**
- 99.9% successful load rate
- Graceful degradation for missing features
- Automatic recovery from transient failures
- No data loss on crashes

**Security:**
- Input validation on all user data
- Safe localStorage access with try-catch
- No eval() or dynamic code execution
- XSS prevention in user content

**Compatibility:**
- Chrome/Edge (last 2 versions)
- Firefox (last 2 versions)
- Safari (last 2 versions)
- File protocol support
- Mobile responsive

**Developer Experience:**
- Clear error messages with stack traces
- Source maps for debugging
- Hot reload in development
- Comprehensive logging

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Zero blank pages** - Game always shows visual feedback
2. **100% character creation success rate** - No failures on first attempt
3. **< 3 second load time** - From page load to playable
4. **Zero uncaught exceptions** - All errors handled gracefully
5. **100% module load success** - All required modules initialize

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Page Load Time (PLT) < 3 seconds
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 5 seconds
- JavaScript Error Rate = 0
- Successful Session Start Rate = 100%
- Module Health Check Pass Rate = 100%
- Test Coverage > 80%
- Build Success Rate = 100%

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must work with vanilla JavaScript (no build required)
- Cannot require server-side components
- Must support file:// protocol
- Limited to browser localStorage for persistence

### Timeline Constraints
- Must be completed within 2-3 days
- Cannot break existing save data
- Incremental fixes must not worsen stability

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer
- No external dependencies allowed
- Must use existing project structure

### Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers (2022+)
- localStorage is available and enabled
- Users have stable internet for web fonts
- Screen resolution minimum 1024x768

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building:**
- New game features or content
- Visual redesign or UI overhaul
- Multiplayer or online features
- Backend services or APIs
- Mobile native apps
- Build system or bundling
- TypeScript migration
- Framework adoption (React, Vue, etc.)
- Database integration
- User authentication system

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- None (vanilla JavaScript only)
- Web fonts (fallback to system fonts)
- Browser localStorage API
- Browser console API

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing module architecture
- Current save data format
- Existing UI components
- Character creation flow
- Game state management

### Prerequisite Work
- Complete analysis of all error logs
- Document current module dependencies
- Map all failure points
- Identify all API mismatches

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Breaking existing saves**
   - Mitigation: Backward compatibility layer

2. **Introducing new bugs**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite first

3. **Performance regression**
   - Mitigation: Performance benchmarks before/after

4. **Browser incompatibility**
   - Mitigation: Test on all target browsers

## Implementation Approach

- Repair UI update mechanisms

### Phase 3: Gameplay Validation (Day 2)
- Run complete gameplay simulation
- Test all game systems (combat, crafting, shop)
- Verify progression mechanics
- Test resource generation
- Validate save/load at each stage

### Phase 4: Final Validation (Day 3)
- End-to-end testing
- Load from all environments
- Multi-hour idle testing
- Browser compatibility
- Performance benchmarks
- Sign-off criteria

## Rollback Plan

If fixes cause worse issues:
1. Git revert to previous commit

3. Create hotfix branch
4. Test individual fixes in isolation
5. Re-apply fixes incrementally
