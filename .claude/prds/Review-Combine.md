# PRD: Review-Combine

## Executive Summary

The Review-Combine system is a critical integration validation platform designed to review, test, and validate the seamless operation of all 12 MMORPG systems that were just implemented across 7 parallel agent streams. This system ensures that all interconnected components work together as intended, with comprehensive Playwright-based end-to-end testing, integration validation, and production-ready code verification.

**Value Proposition**: Prevent integration failures, ensure system reliability, and validate that the complete MMORPG transformation delivers the intended user experience without breaking existing functionality.

## Problem Statement

### What Problem Are We Solving?

After implementing 12 major MMORPG systems across parallel development streams:
- **Universal CP System** (3 streams)
- **Equipment System** (3 streams)
- **Zone/Monster Database** (3 streams)
- **Idle Hunting System** (3 streams)
- **Crafting Professions** (3 streams)
- **Material & Recipe System** (3 streams)
- **Player Trading** (3 streams)
- **Market Economy** (3 streams)
- **Boss Events** (3 streams)
- **VIP System** (3 streams)
- **Economic Balance** (3 streams)
- **UI Integration** (3 streams)

**Critical Integration Risks:**
1. **Data Flow Inconsistencies**: Systems may not properly share data or trigger cascading updates
2. **Performance Degradation**: Combined systems may not meet 60fps and sub-10ms performance targets
3. **UI/UX Conflicts**: Interface elements may conflict or create poor user experience
4. **Economic Imbalances**: Interconnected economic systems may create exploitable loops
5. **Save/Load Corruption**: Complex data structures may not persist or restore correctly
6. **Cross-System Dependencies**: Failure in one system may cascade to others

### Why Is This Important Now?

- **Production Readiness**: All systems must work together before deployment
- **User Experience**: Players will interact with multiple systems simultaneously
- **Data Integrity**: Complex save states require validation across all systems
- **Performance Validation**: 60fps requirement must be maintained with all systems active
- **Economic Stability**: Player-driven economy must be balanced and exploit-free
