# PRD: Merge-Branches

## Executive Summary

Consolidate substantial completed functionality currently split across multiple epic branches into a unified master branch, creating a comprehensive idle cultivation game with MMORPG features, mobile infrastructure, advanced progression systems, and production-ready integration testing. This critical infrastructure project will merge 4 major epics representing 50+ completed features and 100+ hours of development work.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Issues
- **Fragmented Codebase**: Core game functionality is split across 4+ separate branches
- **Development Complexity**: Difficult to understand the complete system architecture
- **Integration Risk**: Features developed in isolation may have compatibility issues
- **Deployment Challenges**: Cannot deploy the complete feature set from master branch
- **Team Coordination**: Developers cannot see the full scope of available features
- **Testing Gaps**: Integration testing exists but is isolated from main codebase

### Why This is Critical Now
- **Production Readiness**: Multiple epics are 100% complete and production-ready
- **Technical Debt**: Longer branches remain separate, higher risk of merge conflicts
- **Team Productivity**: Current state blocks further development on integrated features
- **User Value**: Complete game experience cannot be deployed without merge

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**Development Team**
- As a developer, I want to work from a unified codebase that contains all completed features
- As a developer, I want to understand the complete system architecture without switching branches
- As a developer, I want to build new features on top of existing MMORPG and progression systems

**DevOps/Release Manager**
- As a release manager, I want to deploy the complete game experience from master branch
- As a DevOps engineer, I want a single source of truth for production deployments
- As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive integration testing available in the main branch

**QA/Testing Team**

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Git History**: Must preserve meaningful commit history from all branches
- **File System**: Windows-specific paths and line endings must be maintained
- **Dependencies**: All package.json and configuration files must be compatible
- **Database**: Schema changes from different branches must be reconciled

### Timeline Constraints
- **Merge Window**: Limited time window to minimize disruption to ongoing development
