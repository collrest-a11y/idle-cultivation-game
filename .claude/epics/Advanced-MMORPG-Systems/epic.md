# Epic: Advanced-MMORPG-Systems

## Overview
Transform the idle cultivation game into a comprehensive MMORPG by implementing a unified Combat Power (CP) system that serves as the foundation for monster hunting, interdependent crafting professions, player trading, scheduled boss battles, VIP progression, and monetization systems. This epic focuses on leveraging existing game architecture while adding deep interconnected systems that create multiple progression paths and engagement loops.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Universal CP System**: Extend existing cultivation system to include CP calculations from equipment, scriptures, crafting, VIP, and sect bonuses
- **State Management**: Expand current game state to include profession progress, market data, boss schedules, and VIP status
- **Data Architecture**: Use existing localStorage persistence with new data structures for professions, trading, and boss systems
- **UI Framework**: Build upon existing Girls' Frontline UI components for consistency
- **Performance**: Implement idle calculation patterns similar to existing cultivation system for hunting and crafting

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **CP Display System**: Real-time CP calculation and breakdown visualization
- **Zone/Monster Browser**: Interactive hunting location selection with CP gating
- **Crafting Interface**: Four-profession system with recipe trees and material requirements
- **Market/Trading Hub**: Player-to-player trading with search, filters, and price tracking
- **Boss Event System**: Real-time boss battles with participation tracking
- **VIP Dashboard**: Benefit tracking, purchase interface, and exclusive content access

### Backend Services
- **CP Calculation Engine**: Centralized system for calculating total CP from all sources
- **Idle Systems Manager**: Background processing for hunting, crafting, and offline progression
- **Market Engine**: Trading system with pricing algorithms and transaction processing
- **Boss Event Scheduler**: Time-based boss spawning and participation management
- **VIP Progression System**: Purchase tracking, benefit application, and exclusive content gating

### Infrastructure
- **Data Migration**: Extend existing save system to support new data structures
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient calculations for long-running idle sessions
- **State Synchronization**: Ensure consistent state across all interconnected systems

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core CP System
Establish the universal Combat Power system as the foundation for all other features. Extend existing cultivation calculations to include equipment, scriptures, and bonuses.

### Phase 2: Monster Hunting & Zones
Implement the PvE system with zone progression, monster databases, and idle hunting mechanics that build upon existing idle cultivation patterns.

### Phase 3: Crafting Professions
Add four interconnected crafting professions with material dependencies, recipe systems, and profession leveling that creates economic depth.

### Phase 4: Trading & Market
Develop player-to-player trading with market systems, pricing mechanisms, and sect resource sharing.

### Phase 5: Boss Events & VIP
Complete the system with scheduled boss battles and VIP progression that provides monetization and endgame content.

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] Universal CP System: Extend cultivation system with equipment, VIP, and sect bonuses
- [ ] Monster Hunting Zones: Implement zone progression with CP gating and idle hunting mechanics
- [ ] Interdependent Crafting: Create four-profession system with material dependencies
- [ ] Player Trading Market: Build trading interface with search, pricing, and transaction systems
- [ ] Scheduled Boss Events: Implement world and sect boss systems with real-time participation
- [ ] VIP Progression System: Add monetization layer with benefits and exclusive content
- [ ] Economic Balance: Tune material flows, pricing, and progression curves
- [ ] UI Integration: Ensure consistent Girls' Frontline theme across all new systems

## Dependencies
- Existing cultivation system and CP calculations
- Current save/load infrastructure and state management
- Girls' Frontline UI component library
- Current sect system for expansion into sect trading and bosses

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- **Performance**: All idle calculations complete within 100ms for 24-hour offline sessions
- **Data Integrity**: Zero save corruption with comprehensive migration system
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration with existing UI maintaining 60fps
- **Economic Balance**: Material flow creates sustainable player-driven economy
- **Scalability**: System supports concurrent boss events and market transactions

## Estimated Effort
- **Overall Timeline**: 6-8 weeks for complete implementation
- **Critical Path**: CP system → Hunting → Crafting → Trading → Bosses → VIP
- **Risk Mitigation**: Implement each system as self-contained module with existing game integration points
- **Testing Strategy**: Each system tested in isolation before integration, with comprehensive balance testing for economic systems
