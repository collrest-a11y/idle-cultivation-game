# Task: Idle Monster Hunting System

## Description
Implement background monster hunting with idle calculations, experience gain, and loot collection. Integrate with existing idle calculation patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Idle hunting mechanics with offline progression
- [ ] Experience and loot calculation system
- [ ] Hunting efficiency based on CP difference
- [ ] Integration with existing idle calculation patterns
- [ ] Offline progression catches up when player returns

## Technical Details
- Implement idle hunting calculation engine
- Create hunting efficiency algorithms based on CP differences
- Add experience gain and loot distribution systems
- Integrate with existing idle game loop and offline progression
- Ensure hunting continues during offline periods

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Universal CP System) for efficiency calculations
- [ ] Task 003 (Zone and Monster Database) for hunting targets
- [ ] Existing idle calculation patterns understanding
- [ ] Save system integration for offline progression

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 14-18 hours
- Parallel: false (requires CP system and zone database)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Idle hunting system implemented and functional
- [ ] Offline progression calculates hunting results correctly
- [ ] Experience gain system integrated with hunting
- [ ] Loot system distributes rewards based on hunting efficiency
- [ ] Tests cover idle calculations and offline progression
- [ ] Performance meets requirements for 24-hour offline sessions
