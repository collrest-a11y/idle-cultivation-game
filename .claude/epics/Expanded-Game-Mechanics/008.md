# Task: Balance and Testing

## Description
Comprehensive testing and balance adjustment of all new systems including scripture progression curves, event reward rates, tournament fairness, and overall game economy impact. This includes automated testing, balance validation, and performance optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scripture progression curve balanced and tested
- [ ] Event reward rates provide meaningful progression
- [ ] Tournament system ensures fair competition
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for all new features
- [ ] No memory leaks or infinite loops detected

## Technical Details
- Create automated test suite for all new mechanics
- Implement balance validation algorithms
- Conduct load testing for tournament and event systems
- Profile memory usage and optimize where needed
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks must be substantially complete
- [ ] Existing testing framework
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed systems)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite created and passing
- [ ] Balance parameters validated and adjusted
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Bug fixes implemented
- [ ] System stability verified
