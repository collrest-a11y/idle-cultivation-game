Implement leveling, XP gain, and evolution mechanics for existing scriptures. This foundational system extends the current scripture templates with progression mechanics while maintaining backward compatibility with existing save files.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scripture objects have level, XP, and max level properties
- [ ] XP gain mechanics integrated with existing cultivation actions
- [ ] Evolution system that unlocks new abilities at level milestones
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing scripture save data
- [ ] Performance optimized for continuous XP accumulation

## Technical Details
- Extend existing scripture template structure in game.js
- Add XP calculation based on cultivation efficiency and time
- Implement level-based stat bonuses and ability unlocks
- Create evolution conditions and upgrade paths
- Integrate with existing tick system for continuous progression

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing scripture system and templates
- [ ] Current save/load infrastructure
- [ ] Tick system for continuous updates

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-24 hours
- Parallel: false (foundational for other scripture features)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full scripture progression
- [ ] Tests written for XP calculation and leveling
- [ ] Existing saves load correctly with new system
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Balance tested for progression curve
