# Epic: Expanded-Game-Mechanics

## Overview
Enhance the existing idle cultivation game by implementing three core expansion areas: Enhanced Scripture System (leveling/evolution), Seasonal Events framework, and PvP Tournament system. These additions will leverage the existing architecture while providing new progression paths and engagement mechanics.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Monolithic Extension**: Continue single-file architecture (game.js) to maintain simplicity
- **Event-Driven Framework**: Extend existing event system for seasonal content and tournaments
- **State-Based Enhancement**: Build on existing save/load system for scripture progression
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure all enhancements work with existing save files

## Technical Approach
### Frontend Components
- **Scripture Enhancement UI**: Modal system for leveling scriptures using existing card layout
- **Tournament Interface**: Bracket-style UI using existing combat simulation framework
- **Event Dashboard**: Tab integration into existing navigation for seasonal content
- **Progress Indicators**: Enhanced progress bars for scripture XP and tournament standing

### Backend Services
- **Scripture Evolution System**: Extend existing scripture templates with leveling mechanics
- **Event Management**: Time-based event activation using existing tick system
- **Tournament Logic**: Bracket generation and progression tracking
- **Reward Distribution**: Enhanced reward calculation system

### Infrastructure
- **Save Compatibility**: Version migration for new data structures
- **Performance**: Efficient tournament simulation for multiple participants
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup of expired events and tournament data

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Scripture enhancement system (foundational for other features)
- **Phase 2**: Seasonal event framework (provides engagement testing ground)
- **Phase 3**: PvP tournament system (builds on combat and event systems)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Each phase is independently functional
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of progression curves and balance

## Implementation Issues

### Phase 1: Core Scripture Enhancement (Foundation)
- [x] **Issue #1**: [Scripture Enhancement System - Core Leveling Mechanics](issue-01-scripture-enhancement-system.md)
  - Priority: High | Effort: 3-4 days | Dependencies: None
  - Implement scripture level progression, XP mechanics, and evolution system

- [x] **Issue #2**: [Enhanced Scripture UI - Leveling Interface and Visual Feedback](issue-02-enhanced-scripture-ui.md)
  - Priority: High | Effort: 2-3 days | Dependencies: Issue #1
  - Create enhancement UI, progress visualization, and level-up animations

### Phase 2: Seasonal Events (Engagement Framework)
- [x] **Issue #3**: [Seasonal Event Framework - Time-based Events with Rewards](issue-03-seasonal-event-framework.md)
  - Priority: Medium | Effort: 4-5 days | Dependencies: None
  - Build event scheduling, progression tracking, and reward distribution

- [x] **Issue #4**: [Event Management UI - Event Dashboard and Participation Interfaces](issue-04-event-management-ui.md)
  - Priority: Medium | Effort: 3-4 days | Dependencies: Issue #3
  - Design event discovery, participation tracking, and notification systems

### Phase 3: PvP Tournaments (Competitive Framework)
- [x] **Issue #5**: [PvP Tournament System - Bracket-based Competitive Gameplay](issue-05-pvp-tournament-system.md)
  - Priority: Medium | Effort: 5-6 days | Dependencies: None
  - Implement tournament brackets, rankings, and automated combat simulation

- [x] **Issue #6**: [Tournament Interface - Tournament Lobby, Brackets, and Results](issue-06-tournament-interface.md)
  - Priority: Medium | Effort: 4-5 days | Dependencies: Issue #5
  - Create tournament discovery, bracket visualization, and spectator features

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [x] **Issue #7**: [Reward Integration - Enhanced Reward System for New Content](issue-07-reward-integration.md)
  - Priority: Medium | Effort: 3-4 days | Dependencies: Issues #1, #3, #5
  - Extend reward system for all new content types and distribution methods

- [x] **Issue #8**: [Save System Migration - Update Save/Load for New Data Structures](issue-08-save-system-migration.md)
  - Priority: High | Effort: 2-3 days | Dependencies: Issues #1, #3, #5, #7
  - Implement data migration, version management, and backward compatibility

- [x] **Issue #9**: [Balance and Testing - Comprehensive Testing and Balance Adjustment](issue-09-balance-testing.md)
  - Priority: High | Effort: 4-5 days | Dependencies: All previous issues
  - Conduct comprehensive testing, balance validation, and performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Existing combat simulation system for tournament functionality
- Current gacha/scripture system as foundation for enhancements
- Existing UI framework for new interface components
- Save/load system for data persistence

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- **Performance**: No degradation in tick rate or save/load times
- **Compatibility**: All existing saves work with new features
- **Balance**: Scripture enhancement maintains existing progression curve
- **Engagement**: Events and tournaments provide meaningful progression
- **Stability**: No memory leaks or infinite loops in event/tournament systems

## Estimated Effort
- **Overall Timeline**: 29-39 days for complete implementation (6-8 weeks)
  - Phase 1 (Scripture): 5-7 days
  - Phase 2 (Events): 7-9 days
  - Phase 3 (Tournaments): 9-11 days
  - Cross-cutting: 8-12 days
- **Critical Path**: Scripture system → Events → Tournaments → Integration → Testing
- **Resource Requirements**: Single developer with existing codebase knowledge
- **Testing Phase**: 4-5 days for comprehensive testing and balance validation

## Issue Summary
- **Total Issues**: 9 comprehensive implementation issues
- **High Priority**: 4 issues (Scripture core, Scripture UI, Save Migration, Balance/Testing)
- **Medium Priority**: 5 issues (Events, Tournaments, Rewards, UIs)
- **Dependencies**: Clear dependency chain ensuring logical implementation order
- **Phase Distribution**: 3 main development phases plus cross-cutting concerns
