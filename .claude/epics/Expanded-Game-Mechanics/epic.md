# Epic: Expanded-Game-Mechanics

## Overview
Enhance the existing idle cultivation game by implementing three core expansion areas: Enhanced Scripture System (leveling/evolution), Seasonal Events framework, and PvP Tournament system. These additions will leverage the existing architecture while providing new progression paths and engagement mechanics.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Monolithic Extension**: Continue single-file architecture (game.js) to maintain simplicity
- **Event-Driven Framework**: Extend existing event system for seasonal content and tournaments
- **State-Based Enhancement**: Build on existing save/load system for scripture progression
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure all enhancements work with existing save files

## Technical Approach
### Frontend Components
- **Scripture Enhancement UI**: Modal system for leveling scriptures using existing card layout
- **Tournament Interface**: Bracket-style UI using existing combat simulation framework
- **Event Dashboard**: Tab integration into existing navigation for seasonal content
- **Progress Indicators**: Enhanced progress bars for scripture XP and tournament standing

### Backend Services
- **Scripture Evolution System**: Extend existing scripture templates with leveling mechanics
- **Event Management**: Time-based event activation using existing tick system
- **Tournament Logic**: Bracket generation and progression tracking
- **Reward Distribution**: Enhanced reward calculation system

### Infrastructure
- **Save Compatibility**: Version migration for new data structures
- **Performance**: Efficient tournament simulation for multiple participants
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup of expired events and tournament data

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Scripture enhancement system (foundational for other features)
- **Phase 2**: Seasonal event framework (provides engagement testing ground)
- **Phase 3**: PvP tournament system (builds on combat and event systems)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Each phase is independently functional
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of progression curves and balance

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] Scripture Enhancement System: Add leveling, XP gain, and evolution mechanics to existing scriptures
- [ ] Enhanced Scripture UI: Create leveling interface and visual feedback systems
- [ ] Seasonal Event Framework: Implement time-based events with unique rewards and challenges
- [ ] Event Management UI: Create event dashboard and participation interfaces
- [ ] PvP Tournament System: Build bracket-based competitive gameplay with rankings
- [ ] Tournament Interface: Design tournament lobby, brackets, and results display
- [ ] Reward Integration: Enhance existing reward system for new content types
- [ ] Balance and Testing: Comprehensive testing and balance adjustment of all new systems
- [ ] Save System Migration: Update save/load to handle new data structures
- [ ] Documentation: Update game mechanics documentation and player guides

## Dependencies
- Existing combat simulation system for tournament functionality
- Current gacha/scripture system as foundation for enhancements
- Existing UI framework for new interface components
- Save/load system for data persistence

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- **Performance**: No degradation in tick rate or save/load times
- **Compatibility**: All existing saves work with new features
- **Balance**: Scripture enhancement maintains existing progression curve
- **Engagement**: Events and tournaments provide meaningful progression
- **Stability**: No memory leaks or infinite loops in event/tournament systems

## Estimated Effort
- **Overall Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for complete implementation
- **Critical Path**: Scripture system → Events → Tournaments
- **Resource Requirements**: Single developer with existing codebase knowledge
- **Testing Phase**: 1 week for balance testing and bug fixes
