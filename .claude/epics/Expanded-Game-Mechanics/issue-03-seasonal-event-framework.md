# Issue: Seasonal Event Framework - Time-based Events with Rewards

## Description
Implement a comprehensive seasonal event system that provides time-limited content, unique rewards, and special challenges. This framework will leverage the existing TimeManager and EventManager to create engaging periodic content that keeps players returning to the game.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Event System Core
- [ ] Time-based event activation and expiration system
- [ ] Event configuration with start/end dates, rewards, and requirements
- [ ] Multiple concurrent event support with priority system
- [ ] Event progress tracking and persistence across sessions
- [ ] Automatic event cleanup when expired

### Event Types Implementation
- [ ] **Cultivation Boost Events**: Increased XP/resource gain for limited time
- [ ] **Special Challenge Events**: Unique objectives with exclusive rewards
- [ ] **Festival Events**: Themed content with special activities
- [ ] **Double Reward Events**: Enhanced drops from specific activities
- [ ] **Community Events**: Server-wide goals with shared rewards

### Event Progression System
- [ ] Individual event progress tracking (points, completions, milestones)
- [ ] Tiered reward system with multiple completion levels
- [ ] Event leaderboards for competitive elements
- [ ] Achievement integration for event participation
- [ ] Retroactive rewards for offline progress during events

### Event Configuration
- [ ] JSON-based event definitions with flexible parameters
- [ ] Dynamic event loading without game restart
- [ ] Event scheduling system for automatic activation
- [ ] A/B testing support for different event configurations
- [ ] Event template system for recurring seasonal events

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Create/Modify
- `js/systems/EventFramework.js` - Core event management system
- `js/systems/SeasonalEventManager.js` - Seasonal event logic
- `js/data/event-data.js` - Event definitions and templates
- `js/systems/EventIntegration.js` - Integration with existing systems
- `js/utils/EventScheduler.js` - Event timing and activation logic

### Core Event System Architecture
```javascript
class EventFramework {
  constructor(gameState, eventManager, timeManager) {
    this.activeEvents = new Map();
    this.eventHistory = new Map();
    this.eventScheduler = new EventScheduler();
    this.eventProgress = new Map();
  }

  // Core event lifecycle
  activateEvent(eventConfig)
  deactivateEvent(eventId)
  processEventTick(deltaTime)
  checkEventTriggers()

  // Progress tracking
  updateEventProgress(eventId, progressType, amount)
  getEventProgress(eventId)
  claimEventReward(eventId, tierId)

  // Event queries
  getActiveEvents()
  isEventActive(eventId)
  getEventTimeRemaining(eventId)
}

class SeasonalEvent {
  constructor(config) {
    this.id = config.id;
    this.type = config.type;
    this.startTime = config.startTime;
    this.endTime = config.endTime;
    this.requirements = config.requirements;
    this.rewards = config.rewards;
    this.progress = new Map();
  }

  canParticipate(player)
  processProgress(action, amount)
  calculateRewards(completionLevel)
  isExpired(currentTime)
}
```

### Event Configuration Schema
```javascript
// Example event configuration
{
  id: "spring_cultivation_festival_2025",
  name: "Spring Cultivation Festival",
  description: "Celebrate the season of growth with enhanced cultivation gains",
  type: "cultivation_boost",

  timing: {
    startTime: "2025-03-20T00:00:00Z",
    endTime: "2025-03-27T23:59:59Z",
    timezone: "UTC"
  },

  requirements: {
    minRealm: "foundation_establishment",
    minLevel: 1,
    questsCompleted: []
  },

  effects: {
    cultivationXpMultiplier: 2.0,
    resourceGainMultiplier: 1.5,
    breakthroughChanceBonus: 0.1
  },

  rewards: {
    participation: {
      jade: 1000,
      crystals: 50,
      scriptures: ["rare_random"]
    },
    milestones: [
      {
        requirement: { cultivationMinutes: 60 },
        rewards: { jade: 2000, crystals: 100 }
      },
      {
        requirement: { cultivationMinutes: 180 },
        rewards: { jade: 5000, scriptures: ["epic_random"] }
      },
      {
        requirement: { cultivationMinutes: 360 },
        rewards: { jade: 10000, scriptures: ["legendary_random"] }
      }
    ]
  },

  ui: {
    bannerImage: "events/spring_festival_banner.jpg",
    accentColor: "#4CAF50",
    iconUrl: "events/spring_icon.png"
  }
}
```

### Integration Points
- **TimeManager**: Event scheduling and real-time updates
- **CultivationSystem**: Cultivation boost events
- **QuestSystem**: Special event quests and objectives
- **RewardManager**: Event reward distribution
- **AchievementManager**: Event-specific achievements
- **SaveManager**: Event progress persistence

## Event Types Detailed Design

### 1. Cultivation Boost Events
- Multiply XP gain from cultivation by configurable factor
- Increase breakthrough success rates
- Enhanced resource generation during cultivation
- Special cultivation animations and effects

### 2. Special Challenge Events
- Unique objectives not found in regular gameplay
- Time-limited cultivation techniques or methods
- Special enemy encounters with unique rewards
- Mini-games integrated into cultivation process

### 3. Festival Events
- Themed UI changes and decorations
- Special storyline quests related to the festival
- Unique scripture collections available only during festival
- Community activities and shared goals

### 4. Double Reward Events
- Increased drops from specific activities (combat, quests, gacha)
- Bonus rewards from daily activities
- Enhanced sect contribution rewards
- Special scripture enhancement materials

## User Experience Design

### Event Discovery
- Event notifications when new events become available
- Event calendar showing upcoming and active events
- Event preview with rewards and requirements
- Push notifications for important event milestones

### Event Participation
- Clear progress indicators for all active events
- Real-time updates as progress is made
- Milestone notifications and celebration effects
- Easy access to event details and remaining time

### Event Completion
- Automatic reward claiming for completed milestones
- End-of-event summary with total rewards earned
- Post-event feedback collection for improvement
- Event history tracking for returning content

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Handle system time changes affecting event timing
- Graceful degradation when event data is corrupted
- Offline progress calculation for events
- Event conflicts and priority resolution
- Player timezone considerations for event timing

## Testing Requirements
- Event lifecycle testing (activation, progress, expiration)
- Cross-timezone event timing verification
- Offline progress calculation accuracy
- Event reward distribution integrity
- Performance testing with multiple concurrent events

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient event progress tracking without impacting game performance
- Lazy loading of event assets and configurations
- Minimal memory footprint for inactive events
- Optimized event tick processing
- Event data compression for large configurations

## Success Metrics
- Event participation rate > 60% of active players
- Average event completion rate > 40%
- Player retention increase during event periods
- Positive player feedback on event variety and rewards
- Zero data loss during event transitions

## Security Considerations
- Validate all event progress updates server-side (future multiplayer)
- Prevent event reward exploitation through time manipulation
- Secure event configuration loading and validation
- Rate limiting for event progress updates

## Dependencies
- Existing TimeManager for event scheduling
- EventManager for event communication
- RewardManager for reward distribution
- SaveManager for progress persistence

- Issue #4: Event Management UI (depends on this issue)
- Issue #7: Reward Integration (uses event rewards)
- Issue #1: Scripture Enhancement System (may provide event rewards)
