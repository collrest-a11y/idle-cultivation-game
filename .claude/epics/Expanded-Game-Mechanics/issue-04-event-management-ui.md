## Technical Implementation

### Files to Create/Modify
- `js/views/EventView.js` - Main event dashboard view
- `js/ui/components/EventCard.js` - Individual event display component
- `js/ui/components/EventModal.js` - Detailed event information modal
- `js/ui/components/EventProgress.js` - Event progress visualization
- `css/events.css` - Event-specific styling and themes

### UI Component Architecture
```javascript
class EventView extends GameView {
  constructor(gameState, eventFramework) {
    this.activeEvents = [];
    this.eventHistory = [];
    this.selectedEvent = null;
  }

  renderActiveEvents()
  renderEventCalendar()
  renderEventDetails(eventId)
  handleEventInteraction(eventId, action)
}

class EventCard extends BaseComponent {
  constructor(eventData) {
    this.eventData = eventData;
    this.progressData = null;
  }

  renderEventInfo()
  renderProgressBar()
  renderTimeRemaining()
  renderRewardPreview()
}

class EventModal extends Modal {
  renderEventDescription()
  renderObjectives()
  renderRewardTiers()
  renderParticipationButton()
  handleRewardClaim(tierId)
}
```

### Event Dashboard Layout
```html
<div class="event-dashboard">

          </div>
          <span class="progress-text">65% Complete</span>
        </div>
        <div class="event-timer">
