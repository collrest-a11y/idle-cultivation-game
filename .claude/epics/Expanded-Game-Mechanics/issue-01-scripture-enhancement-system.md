# Issue: Scripture Enhancement System - Core Leveling Mechanics

## Description
Implement a comprehensive scripture leveling system that allows players to enhance their scriptures through experience gain and evolution mechanics. This system will extend the existing ScriptureManager to add progression mechanics while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Leveling System
- [ ] Add level tracking to scripture instances (level 1-10)
- [ ] Implement XP gain mechanics through cultivation activities
- [ ] Create level-up bonus calculations for scripture effects
- [ ] Add evolution system for max-level scriptures (transforms to higher rarity)
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing save files

### Experience Mechanics
- [ ] Scriptures gain XP when equipped during cultivation sessions
- [ ] XP gain rate scales with cultivation realm and scripture rarity
- [ ] Implement XP requirements curve (exponential growth per level)
- [ ] Add XP overflow handling for smooth progression

### Enhancement Effects
- [ ] Level bonuses increase scripture base effects by 10% per level
- [ ] Evolution transforms scripture to next rarity tier with new effects
- [ ] Preserve original scripture ID for collection tracking
- [ ] Add enhancement bonus display in scripture tooltips

### Data Structure Changes
- [ ] Extend scripture data model with level, xp, maxXp fields
- [ ] Update ScriptureManager to handle enhanced scriptures
- [ ] Implement scripture enhancement save/load functionality
- [ ] Add migration system for existing scripture collections

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify
- `js/systems/ScriptureManager.js` - Add enhancement logic
- `js/data/scripture-data.js` - Add enhancement templates
- `js/systems/ScriptureIntegration.js` - Update integration points
- `js/systems/EnhancementSystem.js` - Extend existing enhancement logic

### Key Methods
```javascript
// ScriptureManager additions
enhanceScripture(scriptureId, xpGain)
canEvolveScripture(scriptureId)
evolveScripture(scriptureId)
calculateLevelBonus(baseEffect, level, rarity)
getEnhancementRequirements(scriptureId)

// Scripture data model
{
  id: string,
  level: number,
  currentXp: number,
  maxXp: number,
  isEvolved: boolean,
  evolutionSource: string, // Original scripture ID
  // ... existing fields
}
```

### XP Gain Formula
```javascript
const baseXpGain = cultivationSession.duration * scripture.rarity.multiplier;
const realmBonus = player.realm.level * 0.1;
const finalXp = baseXpGain * (1 + realmBonus);
```

### Level Progression
- Level 1-5: Moderate XP requirements (for quick early progression)
- Level 6-8: Steep XP curve (for meaningful investment)
- Level 9-10: Very high requirements (for dedicated enhancement)
- Max level scriptures can evolve to next rarity tier

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Handle scripture enhancement during active cultivation
- Prevent XP gain on unequipped scriptures
- Validate enhancement state on game load
- Handle evolution of equipped scriptures gracefully
- Ensure UI updates reflect enhancement changes immediately

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for XP calculation and level progression
- Integration tests with cultivation system
- Save/load tests for enhanced scriptures
- Performance tests for large scripture collections
- Balance testing for enhancement progression curve

## Performance Considerations
- Cache enhancement calculations for equipped scriptures
- Batch XP updates during cultivation ticks
- Optimize scripture effect recalculation
- Minimal memory overhead for enhancement data

## Success Metrics
- Players can level scriptures from 1-10 through normal gameplay
- Enhancement provides meaningful but balanced power increase
- Evolution system creates long-term progression goals
- No performance degradation with enhanced scriptures
- Zero data loss during save/load operations

## Dependencies
- Existing ScriptureManager and cultivation systems
- Save/load system for data persistence
- EventManager for enhancement notifications

## Related Issues
- Issue #2: Enhanced Scripture UI (depends on this issue)
- Issue #7: Reward Integration (uses enhancement rewards)
- Issue #8: Save System Migration (requires enhancement data structures)
