# Issue: PvP Tournament System - Bracket-based Competitive Gameplay

## Description
Implement a comprehensive PvP tournament system that allows players to compete against each other in structured bracket-style competitions. This system will leverage the existing CombatSystem and TournamentSystem to create engaging competitive gameplay with rankings, rewards, and seasonal tournaments.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Tournament Structure
- [ ] Single and double elimination bracket support
- [ ] Swiss-system tournaments for large participant pools
- [ ] Round-robin tournaments for smaller groups
- [ ] Seeded bracket generation based on player power/ranking
- [ ] Automatic bracket progression and match scheduling

### Tournament Types
- [ ] **Daily Quick Tournaments**: 1-2 hour competitions with immediate rewards
- [ ] **Weekly Championship**: Longer tournaments with prestigious rewards
- [ ] **Seasonal Grand Tournament**: Month-long competitions with exclusive prizes
- [ ] **Sect vs Sect Tournaments**: Team-based competitions between sects
- [ ] **Realm-Restricted Tournaments**: Competitions limited by cultivation realm

### Competitive Features
- [ ] Player ranking system with ELO-style rating
- [ ] Tournament history and statistics tracking
- [ ] Spectator mode for ongoing matches
- [ ] Replay system for completed matches
- [ ] Leaderboards with seasonal resets

### Tournament Mechanics
- [ ] Automated combat simulation using existing CombatSystem
- [ ] Power balancing mechanisms for fair competition
- [ ] Tournament entry fees and prize pools
- [ ] Anti-cheating measures and validation
- [ ] Timeout handling for inactive players

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Create/Modify
- `js/systems/PvPTournamentSystem.js` - Core tournament management
- `js/systems/TournamentBracket.js` - Bracket generation and management
- `js/systems/TournamentMatch.js` - Individual match handling
- `js/systems/PlayerRanking.js` - Ranking and ELO calculation
- `js/systems/TournamentIntegration.js` - Integration with existing systems

### Tournament System Architecture
```javascript
class PvPTournamentSystem {
  constructor(gameState, combatSystem, eventManager) {
    this.activeTournaments = new Map();
    this.tournamentHistory = new Map();
    this.playerRankings = new PlayerRanking();
    this.matchQueue = [];
  }

  // Tournament lifecycle
  createTournament(config)
  registerPlayer(tournamentId, playerId)
  startTournament(tournamentId)
  processMatches(tournamentId)
  completeTournament(tournamentId)

  // Bracket management
  generateBracket(players, type)
  advanceToNextRound(tournamentId)
  handlePlayerAdvancement(tournamentId, playerId)

  // Match processing
  simulateMatch(player1, player2, matchConfig)
  recordMatchResult(tournamentId, matchId, result)
  handleMatchTimeout(tournamentId, matchId)
}

class TournamentBracket {
  constructor(players, type, seeded = true) {
    this.players = players;
    this.type = type; // 'single', 'double', 'swiss', 'roundrobin'
    this.rounds = [];
    this.currentRound = 0;
  }

  generateSingleElimination()
  generateDoubleElimination()
  generateSwissSystem()
  generateRoundRobin()
  seedPlayers(players)
}

class TournamentMatch {
  constructor(player1, player2, config) {
    this.player1 = player1;
    this.player2 = player2;
    this.config = config;
    this.result = null;
    this.status = 'pending'; // 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'timeout'
  }

  simulate()
  recordResult(winner, loser, details)
  isTimeout()
}
```

### Tournament Configuration Schema
```javascript
{
  id: "weekly_championship_w42_2025",
  name: "Weekly Championship - Week 42",
  type: "single_elimination",

  timing: {
    registrationStart: "2025-10-14T18:00:00Z",
    registrationEnd: "2025-10-15T18:00:00Z",
    tournamentStart: "2025-10-15T19:00:00Z",
    expectedDuration: 120 // minutes
  },

  eligibility: {
    minRealm: "foundation_establishment",
    maxRealm: "nascent_soul",
    minRanking: 0,
    maxRanking: 1000,
    sectRestrictions: []
  },

  structure: {
    maxParticipants: 64,
    minParticipants: 8,
    bracketType: "single_elimination",
    seeded: true,
    allowByes: true
  },

  rewards: {
    entryFee: { jade: 1000 },
    prizePool: { jade: 50000, crystals: 1000 },
    distribution: {
      1: { percentage: 40, bonus: { scriptures: ["legendary_random"] } },
      2: { percentage: 25, bonus: { scriptures: ["epic_random"] } },
      3: { percentage: 15, bonus: { scriptures: ["rare_random"] } },
      4: { percentage: 10 },
      "top8": { percentage: 5 },
      "top16": { percentage: 3 },
      "participation": { jade: 500 }
    }
  },

  rules: {
    matchTimeout: 300, // seconds
    maxMatchDuration: 600,
    powerBalancing: true,
    allowSpectators: true,
    recordReplays: true
  }
}
```

### Player Ranking System
```javascript
class PlayerRanking {
  constructor() {
    this.rankings = new Map(); // playerId -> ranking data
    this.seasons = new Map(); // seasonId -> season data
    this.currentSeason = null;
  }

  calculateELO(playerRating, opponentRating, result, kFactor = 32)
  updatePlayerRanking(playerId, opponent, result, tournament)
  getPlayerRanking(playerId)
  getLeaderboard(season, limit = 100)
  resetSeasonalRankings()
}
```

## Tournament Flow Design

### Registration Phase
1. Tournament announcement appears in Events dashboard
2. Players can view tournament details and requirements
3. Registration opens with entry fee payment
4. Player list updates in real-time showing registered participants
5. Registration closes automatically at scheduled time

### Bracket Generation Phase
1. System validates all registered players
2. Players are seeded based on current ranking
3. Bracket is generated according to tournament type
4. Bracket is published for player review
5. Tournament officially begins

### Competition Phase
1. First round matches are scheduled
2. Matches simulate automatically using CombatSystem
3. Results are posted and bracket updates
4. Players advance to next round
5. Process repeats until winner is determined

### Completion Phase
1. Final match determines tournament winner
2. Rewards are calculated and distributed
3. Rankings are updated based on performance
4. Tournament results are archived
5. Players can view detailed statistics

## Combat Integration

### Power Balancing
- Normalize player power levels for fair competition
- Apply temporary buffs/nerfs to balance extreme differences
- Consider both raw power and strategic scripture combinations
- Account for realm differences with scaling factors

### Match Simulation
- Use existing CombatSystem for automated battles
- Enhanced combat logging for replay functionality
- Randomization seeds for deterministic replays
- Special tournament combat rules and modifiers

### Spectator Features
- Real-time match viewing with combat log
- Player statistics and build information
- Match predictions and community voting
- Chat integration for spectator discussion

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Handle player disconnections during tournaments
- Manage tournament cancellation due to insufficient participants
- Resolve disputes and match irregularities
- Handle server downtime during active tournaments
- Process delayed match results and bracket updates

## Anti-Cheating Measures
- Validate player data before match simulation
- Detect impossible player improvements during tournaments
- Monitor for suspicious match patterns
- Rate limiting for tournament interactions
- Secure match result validation

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient bracket data structures for large tournaments
- Optimized match simulation for concurrent processing
- Memory management for tournament history
- Database optimization for ranking calculations
- Real-time update optimization for active tournaments

## Success Metrics
- Tournament participation rate > 30% of eligible players
- Tournament completion rate > 95%
- Average player satisfaction score > 4.0/5
- Zero critical bugs during tournament execution
- Ranking system accuracy and player acceptance

## Security Considerations
- Secure tournament registration and entry fee handling
- Prevent tournament manipulation and exploitation
- Validate all match results before recording
- Protect player data during competitive play
- Audit trail for all tournament administrative actions

## Dependencies
- Existing CombatSystem for match simulation
- TournamentSystem foundation (if available)
- Player power calculation systems
- Reward distribution infrastructure
