## Context
The CP-Progression-Systems branch contains 8 sophisticated progression enhancement systems built around the PowerCalculator engine. This merge must ensure seamless integration with the newly merged MMORPG systems while maintaining progression balance.

## Requirements

### Pre-Merge Validation
1. **Branch State Verification**
   - Confirm all 8 progression systems are complete
   - Verify PowerCalculator integrity and performance
   - Validate progression balance and scaling
   - Check integration points with MMORPG systems

2. **System Inventory Validation**
   - PowerCalculator Core Engine with multi-factor calculations
   - Artifact System with enhancement mechanics
   - Bloodline System with hereditary bonuses
   - Companion System with evolution mechanics
   - Formation System with tactical positioning
   - Pill Refinement with complex recipes
   - Technique Mastery with skill progression
   - Spiritual Root System with cultivation affinity
   - Territory Management with resource generation

### Merge Execution
1. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Resolve conflicts with newly merged MMORPG systems
   - Integrate PowerCalculator with existing progression
   - Merge progression-related UI components
   - Consolidate calculation engines and avoid duplication

2. **System Integration**
   - Ensure PowerCalculator works with MMORPG leaderboards
   - Integrate artifact system with auction house
   - Connect companion system with social features
   - Link territory management with guild systems

## Technical Implementation

### Merge Commands
```bash
# Ensure we're on master with MMORPG systems integrated
git checkout master
git status

# Create backup branch
git checkout -b backup/pre-progression-merge

# Return to master for merge
git checkout master

# Merge CP Progression Systems
git merge epic/CP-Progression-Systems --no-ff -m "Merge CP Progression Systems epic

Integrates 8 progression enhancement systems:
- PowerCalculator Core Engine with multi-factor calculations
- Artifact System with enhancement and socketing
- Bloodline System with hereditary progression bonuses
- Companion System with evolution and battle mechanics
- Formation System with tactical positioning
- Pill Refinement with complex alchemical recipes
- Technique Mastery with incremental skill progression
- Spiritual Root System with cultivation affinity
- Territory Management with resource generation

Includes comprehensive PowerCalculator validation and optimization."
```

### Validation Steps
1. **PowerCalculator Validation**
```bash
# Core calculation engine tests
npm test -- --grep "PowerCalculator"
npm test -- --grep "calculation engine"
npm test -- --grep "power scaling"

# Performance tests for complex calculations
npm test -- --grep "calculator performance"
npm run test:performance -- --calculator
```

2. **System Integration Tests**
```bash
# Individual system tests
npm test -- --grep "Artifact System"
npm test -- --grep "Bloodline System"
npm test -- --grep "Companion System"
npm test -- --grep "Formation System"
npm test -- --grep "Pill Refinement"
npm test -- --grep "Technique Mastery"
npm test -- --grep "Spiritual Root"
npm test -- --grep "Territory Management"

# Cross-system integration tests
npm test -- --grep "progression integration"
npm test -- --grep "mmorpg progression"
```

## Deliverables

1. **Merged Branch**
   - Clean merge preserving both MMORPG and progression systems
   - PowerCalculator fully integrated and optimized
   - All 8 progression systems operational

2. **PowerCalculator Validation Report**
   - Performance benchmarks and optimization results
   - Calculation accuracy verification
   - Integration testing results with all systems
   - Memory usage and caching effectiveness analysis

3. **Progression Systems Integration Report**
   - Individual system validation results
   - Cross-system interaction verification
   - MMORPG system integration confirmation
   - Balance testing and recommendation report

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - PowerCalculator API documentation

   - Performance optimization notes

## Success Metrics
- PowerCalculator handles all progression calculations accurately
- Zero performance degradation in complex calculation scenarios
- All 8 progression systems enhance gameplay without conflicts
- Seamless integration with existing MMORPG systems
- Progression balance maintained across all systems
- Test coverage maintained or improved

## Rollback Plan
