# Task: Performance Benchmarking and Optimization

## Description
Validate and optimize performance of integrated systems to ensure the unified codebase maintains established performance targets. Conduct comprehensive performance analysis, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimizations for the complete merged system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All systems maintain 60fps target during normal gameplay
- [ ] CP calculations complete in <10ms across all sources
- [ ] Save/load operations complete within established time limits
- [ ] Memory usage stays within acceptable bounds during extended play
- [ ] No performance regression compared to individual epic branches
- [ ] Idle game calculations maintain efficiency for long-running sessions
- [ ] UI responsiveness maintained across all integrated components
- [ ] Network operations (if any) complete within timeout limits
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard shows green metrics
- [ ] Load testing validates system stability under stress

## Technical Details
- Execute performance benchmark suite across all merged systems
- Profile CPU usage during peak operations (CP calculations, save/load, UI updates)
- Monitor memory usage patterns and identify potential leaks
- Test performance under extended idle gameplay sessions (24+ hours)
- Benchmark cross-system operations (leaderboard updates, guild interactions)
- Profile rendering performance with all UI components active
- Test performance with maximum data loads (high-level characters, full inventories)
- Analyze and optimize any performance bottlenecks discovered
- Implement performance optimizations while preserving functionality
- Create performance regression test suite for future development

## Dependencies
- [ ] Completion of all merge phases (Tasks 83-86)
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools and benchmarking framework
- [ ] Test environments configured for performance testing
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics from individual epic branches

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-28 hours
- Parallel: true (can run parallel with Task 87)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance benchmark suite executed with passing results
- [ ] All performance targets validated and documented
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified and optimized
- [ ] Memory usage profiled and optimized if needed
- [ ] Long-running session stability confirmed
- [ ] Performance regression test suite implemented
- [ ] Performance optimization recommendations documented
- [ ] Performance monitoring alerts configured for production
- [ ] Performance test results archived for future reference
