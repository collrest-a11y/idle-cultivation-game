# Task: Documentation and Architecture Updates

## Description
Update all documentation to reflect the integrated architecture after successful merge of all epic branches. Ensure developers and stakeholders have comprehensive understanding of the unified system architecture, APIs, and development workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System architecture documentation updated with integrated design
- [ ] API documentation reflects all merged system endpoints and interfaces
- [ ] Developer setup guide updated for unified codebase
- [ ] Code comments and inline documentation updated
- [ ] System integration diagrams created showing component relationships
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and targets documented
- [ ] Testing framework documentation updated
- [ ] Deployment guide updated for production readiness
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide created for integrated systems
- [ ] Change log documents all integration changes and new capabilities

## Technical Details
- Update README.md with current system capabilities and setup instructions
- Document integrated system architecture with component diagrams
- Update API documentation for all merged system interfaces
- Create system integration flow diagrams showing data flow between components
- Document cross-system dependencies and interaction patterns
- Update testing documentation to reflect integrated test suites
- Document performance characteristics and optimization guidelines
- Create troubleshooting guide for common integration issues
