# Task: Cross-System Integration Validation

## Description
Comprehensive testing of all merged systems working together to ensure complete integration across 12 MMORPG systems, 8 progression systems, and testing framework. Validate cross-system interactions, data flow, and functionality preservation after all merge phases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 12 MMORPG systems function correctly after merge integration
- [ ] All 8 progression systems maintain full functionality
- [ ] Cross-system interactions work seamlessly (CP calculations, leaderboards, guilds, etc.)
- [ ] Save/load system preserves all user progress across integrated systems
- [ ] UI components display data correctly from all merged systems
- [ ] Real-time updates work across all integrated systems
- [ ] Performance targets maintained (60fps, <10ms operations) for integrated systems
- [ ] No data corruption or loss during cross-system operations
- [ ] All system APIs return correct data format and content
- [ ] Integration testing suite validates 95%+ of cross-system interactions

## Technical Details
- Execute comprehensive integration test suite from Review-Combine framework
- Test all CP calculation sources (cultivation + equipment + VIP + sect + progression)
- Validate leaderboard integration with all ranking systems
- Test guild system interactions with member progression and MMORPG features
- Verify auction house integration with equipment and currency systems
- Test event system interactions with all game mechanics
- Validate chat system integration with guild and social features
- Test PvP system integration with CP calculations and leaderboards
- Verify dungeon system integration with progression and rewards
- Test raid system coordination with guild and progression mechanics

## Dependencies
- [ ] Completion of all merge phases (Tasks 83-86)
- [ ] Review-Combine testing framework available and operational
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools configured
- [ ] Test data sets prepared for comprehensive validation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true (can run parallel with Task 88)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Integration test suite executed with 100% pass rate
- [ ] All cross-system interactions validated and documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks confirmed for integrated systems
- [ ] User experience validated across all merged functionality
- [ ] Data integrity confirmed across all system boundaries
- [ ] Integration issues identified and resolved
- [ ] Test results documented with evidence of system integration
- [ ] Regression test suite updated to include cross-system scenarios
