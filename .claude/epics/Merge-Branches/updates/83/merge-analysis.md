## File Overlap Analysis

### Critical Overlaps (High Conflict Risk)

#### Core Game Files
```
js/main.js                    - Advanced-MMORPG vs React-Native vs Review-Combine
js/core/GameState.js          - Advanced-MMORPG vs React-Native vs Review-Combine
index.html                    - Advanced-MMORPG vs React-Native vs Review-Combine
```

#### Skills System Files
```
js/systems/SkillSystem.js     - Advanced-MMORPG vs React-Native vs Review-Combine
js/systems/SkillGachaIntegration.js - All three branches
js/ui/components/SkillDetailModal.js - All three branches
js/ui/components/SkillTreeComponent.js - All three branches
```

#### Mobile Package Management
```
mobile/package.json           - Advanced-MMORPG vs React-Native vs Review-Combine
mobile/package-lock.json      - Advanced-MMORPG vs React-Native vs Review-Combine
```

#### Cultivation Services (Mobile)
```
mobile/src/services/cultivation/* - Advanced-MMORPG vs React-Native vs Review-Combine
mobile/src/store/cultivation/*    - Advanced-MMORPG vs React-Native vs Review-Combine
mobile/src/types/cultivation.ts   - Advanced-MMORPG vs React-Native vs Review-Combine
```

### Generated Files (Auto-Resolvable)
```
backend/src/generated/prisma/* - Advanced-MMORPG vs Review-Combine (27 files)
```

## Dependency Analysis

### Cross-Branch Dependencies

1. **Skills System Foundation**
   - Advanced-MMORPG provides complete implementation
   - Review-Combine adds testing framework
   - React-Native extends with mobile integration

2. **Cultivation System Integration**
   - Advanced-MMORPG provides UI components
   - React-Native provides mobile backend
   - Review-Combine provides testing validation

3. **WebSocket Infrastructure**
   - React-Native provides backend services
   - Advanced-MMORPG provides frontend integration
   - Review-Combine provides monitoring

### Technical Dependencies

- **Prisma Schema:** Advanced-MMORPG and Review-Combine have divergent generated files
- **Package Dependencies:** Mobile packages have potential version conflicts
- **Module System:** Main.js has different module registration patterns

## Code Quality Assessment

### Advanced-MMORPG-Systems
- **Structure:** Excellent, modular architecture
- **Testing:** Limited, relies on manual testing
- **Documentation:** Good inline documentation
- **Performance:** Optimized for production use

### React-Native-Full-Game
- **Structure:** Comprehensive backend architecture
- **Testing:** 1 test file (WebSocketService.test.ts)
- **Documentation:** Extensive README and setup docs
- **Performance:** Designed for production scalability

### Review-Combine
- **Structure:** Testing-focused, integration framework
- **Testing:** Comprehensive integration test suite
- **Documentation:** Process-focused documentation
- **Performance:** Testing infrastructure only

### cp-progression-systems
- **Structure:** Documentation only, no code
- **Testing:** N/A
- **Documentation:** Epic planning documents
- **Performance:** N/A

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK
1. **js/main.js conflicts** - Different module registration patterns
2. **js/core/GameState.js conflicts** - Skills system integration differences
3. **Mobile package.json conflicts** - Dependency version mismatches

### MEDIUM RISK
1. **Skills system file overlaps** - Implementation vs testing differences
2. **Cultivation service conflicts** - Mobile vs testing implementations
3. **Generated Prisma files** - Schema divergence

### LOW RISK
1. **Documentation files** - Merge strategy can handle
2. **cp-progression-systems** - No code conflicts
3. **CSS files** - Style additive changes

## Recommended Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Review-Combine first)
**Rationale:** Establishes testing framework before adding functionality
- Merge Review-Combine → master
- Validate testing infrastructure
- Establish baseline for subsequent merges

### Phase 2: Core Systems (Advanced-MMORPG-Systems)
**Rationale:** Provides stable skills system foundation
- Merge Advanced-MMORPG-Systems → master
- Resolve skills system conflicts
- Validate game functionality with testing framework

### Phase 3: Mobile Integration (React-Native-Full-Game - SELECTIVE)
**Rationale:** Integrate mobile backend without conflicting frontend
- Cherry-pick backend/* changes only
- Merge mobile/src/services/* selectively
- Avoid conflicting js/* and index.html changes

### Phase 4: Documentation (cp-progression-systems)
**Rationale:** No conflicts, pure documentation merge
- Merge cp-progression-systems → master
- Integrate epic planning documentation

## Validation Checkpoints

### After Each Merge:
1. **Build Validation:** Ensure HTML loads without errors
2. **Skills System Test:** Verify skills functionality
3. **Cultivation System Test:** Verify core game loops
4. **Save/Load Test:** Ensure data persistence works
5. **Mobile Package Test:** Verify mobile dependencies resolve

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All game systems functional
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Save/load system maintains compatibility
- [ ] Skills system fully operational
- [ ] Mobile backend services available
- [ ] Testing framework operational

## Emergency Rollback Procedures

### Pre-Merge Preparation:
```bash
git tag merge-checkpoint-before-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git branch backup-master-$(date +%Y%m%d) master
```

### Rollback Commands:
```bash
# Full rollback to pre-merge state
git reset --hard backup-master-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Partial rollback to specific commit
git reset --hard merge-checkpoint-before-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## Next Steps

1. Create backup branches and tags
2. Begin Phase 1 merge (Review-Combine)
3. Execute validation checkpoint
4. Proceed with Phase 2 merge (Advanced-MMORPG-Systems)
5. Continue with phased approach per strategy
