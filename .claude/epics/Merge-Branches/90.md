# Task: Production Readiness Validation

## Description
Final validation and deployment preparation for unified master branch to ensure the integrated system is ready for production deployment. Comprehensive production readiness assessment covering security, reliability, maintainability, and operational concerns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Security audit completed with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Error handling and logging comprehensive across all integrated systems
- [ ] Configuration management validated for production environment
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured for all system components
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Load testing completed under production-like conditions
- [ ] Deployment pipeline validated with integrated codebase
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Production environment configuration verified
- [ ] Go-live checklist completed and approved

## Technical Details
- Conduct security review of integrated systems and dependencies
- Validate error handling patterns across all merged components
- Test and document backup/recovery procedures for save data
- Configure production monitoring and alerting for key metrics
