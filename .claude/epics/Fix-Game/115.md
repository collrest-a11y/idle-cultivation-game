# Task: Fix Save System

## Description

Ensure the save/load system works reliably at every game stage, from initial character creation through end-game progression. Implement comprehensive validation and recovery mechanisms to handle corrupted data, version migrations, and edge cases. Create a robust persistence layer that maintains game state integrity across all scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Save/load works 100% reliably at any point in the game
- [ ] Character creation saves immediately and loads correctly
- [ ] All game progression states persist accurately (levels, resources, items, achievements)
- [ ] Save data validation prevents corruption and provides meaningful error messages
- [ ] Automatic recovery mechanisms handle corrupted save data gracefully
- [ ] Multiple save slots work independently without cross-contamination
- [ ] Save data migration handles version updates seamlessly
- [ ] Auto-save functionality prevents data loss during gameplay
- [ ] Import/export features work for save data backup/restore
- [ ] Performance optimization ensures saves complete within acceptable timeframes

## Technical Details

### Core Save/Load Functionality
- **State Serialization**: Fix JSON serialization/deserialization for all game objects
- **Data Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation for all save data fields
- **Error Recovery**: Add fallback mechanisms for corrupted or incomplete saves
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize save operations for large game states

### Save Data Management
- **Multiple Saves**: Fix save slot management and prevent data conflicts
- **Auto-Save**: Implement reliable automatic saving at key game milestones
- **Manual Save**: Ensure player-initiated saves work in all game states
- **Save Migration**: Handle version updates and data format changes

### Data Integrity Features
- **Validation Layer**: Check all data types, ranges, and relationships before saving
- **Corruption Detection**: Identify and handle corrupted save files
- **Backup System**: Maintain backup saves to prevent total data loss
- **Checksum Verification**: Ensure data integrity during save/load operations

### Edge Case Handling
- **Incomplete Saves**: Handle saves interrupted by browser closure or errors
- **Storage Limitations**: Manage localStorage quota and cleanup old saves
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensure saves work across different browsers
- **Device Migration**: Support save transfer between different devices

**Key Files Affected:**
- `js/core/SaveManager.js`
- `js/core/GameState.js`
- `js/core/DataValidator.js`
- `js/utils/StorageUtils.js`
- All state management modules

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 003 (Fix Core Game Loop) must be completed first
- [ ] Stable game state management required
- [ ] Error handling systems must be functional

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: false (requires stable core systems)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Save/load system works flawlessly in all tested scenarios
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite validates all save/load edge cases
- [ ] Data validation prevents all forms of corruption
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms successfully handle corrupted data
- [ ] Performance testing confirms acceptable save/load times
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Auto-save and manual save features work reliably
- [ ] Save data migration system tested with multiple version scenarios
- [ ] Documentation includes troubleshooting guide for save issues
- [ ] Code review confirms robust error handling and data integrity
