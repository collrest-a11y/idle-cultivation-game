# Task: Fix Game Mechanics

## Description

Repair all combat, crafting, shop, and progression calculations to ensure accurate game mechanics. Fix CP (Combat Power) calculations, resource generation rates, and all mathematical formulas throughout the game. This task focuses on making the core gameplay mechanics function correctly and consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Combat damage calculations are accurate and consistent
- [ ] All CP calculation formulas work correctly across all systems
- [ ] Resource generation (Qi, Spirit Stones, materials) functions properly
- [ ] Crafting system produces correct results with proper resource consumption
- [ ] Shop transactions handle all edge cases (insufficient funds, item availability)
- [ ] Progression systems calculate experience and levels accurately
- [ ] All skill effects apply correctly and stack appropriately
- [ ] Monster scaling and difficulty curves work as intended
- [ ] Item stats and bonuses calculate properly
- [ ] All mathematical operations are validated and error-free

## Technical Details

### Combat System Fixes
- **Damage Calculation**: Repair base damage, multipliers, and defense calculations
- **Critical Hit System**: Fix critical chance and damage multiplier calculations
- **Status Effects**: Ensure all buffs/debuffs apply and expire correctly
- **Monster AI**: Fix behavior patterns and ability usage

### Resource Systems
- **Qi Generation**: Correct passive and active generation rates
- **Spirit Stone Economy**: Fix earning rates and spending mechanics
- **Material Drops**: Ensure proper drop rates and rarity calculations
- **Inventory Management**: Fix stacking, capacity, and item sorting

### Crafting & Shop Systems
- **Recipe Validation**: Ensure all crafting recipes work with correct materials
- **Cost Calculations**: Fix all price calculations and currency conversions
- **Success Rates**: Implement proper crafting success/failure mechanics
- **Shop Availability**: Fix item stock and refresh mechanics

### Progression Systems
- **Experience Calculation**: Fix XP gain formulas for all activities
- **Level Requirements**: Correct leveling curves and requirements
- **Skill Point Distribution**: Fix allocation and spending mechanics
- **Achievement Triggers**: Ensure all achievements unlock properly

**Key Files Affected:**
- `js/core/CombatSystem.js`
- `js/core/CraftingSystem.js`
- `js/core/ShopManager.js`
- `js/core/ProgressionSystem.js`
- `js/core/ResourceManager.js`
- `js/mechanics/`
- All calculation modules

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 003 (Fix Core Game Loop) must be completed first
- [ ] Game loop and state management must be functional
- [ ] Error handling systems must be in place

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XL
- Hours: 32-40 hours
- Parallel: false (requires stable core systems)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All game mechanics function correctly with accurate calculations
- [ ] Manual testing confirms proper behavior in all game scenarios
- [ ] Automated tests validate all mathematical calculations
- [ ] No calculation errors or undefined values in any game system
- [ ] Performance testing shows no degradation from fixes
- [ ] Code review confirms mathematical accuracy and edge case handling
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect corrected mechanics
- [ ] Save compatibility maintained with existing player data
