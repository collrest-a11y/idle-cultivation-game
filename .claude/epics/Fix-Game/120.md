## Description

Ensure character creation works 100% of the time and fix all UI update and rendering issues. This task focuses on making the user-facing aspects of the game completely reliable, including character management and all visual interface components.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Character creation succeeds 100% of the time without errors
- [ ] All UI components render correctly across different screen sizes
- [ ] UI updates happen in real-time reflecting game state changes
- [ ] View management handles navigation and transitions smoothly
- [ ] Character progression displays update accurately
- [ ] All interactive elements respond correctly to user input
- [ ] UI performance is optimized for smooth gameplay experience
- [ ] Accessibility features work properly

## Technical Details

### Character & UI Components
- **Character Creation System**: Name generation, stat initialization, avatar selection
- **Character Progression**: Level-up, skill advancement, stat displays
- **UI Rendering Engine**: Component rendering and update system
- **View Manager**: Screen navigation and state management
- **Input System**: User interaction handling and validation

### Key Fix Areas
- Character creation form validation and submission
- Real-time UI updates and data binding
- Component lifecycle management
- View transitions and navigation
- Input handling and event processing
- Responsive design and layout issues
- Performance optimization for UI rendering
- Error display and user feedback

### Implementation Strategy
1. Analyze character creation failures from diagnostic tests
2. Fix character initialization and validation logic
3. Repair UI rendering and update mechanisms
4. Ensure proper view management and navigation
5. Fix input handling and user interaction
6. Optimize UI performance and responsiveness
7. Test across different devices and screen sizes

## Dependencies

**Depends on**: Task 002 (Fix Module System) - requires stable module infrastructure for UI components
**Can run parallel with**: Task 003 (Fix Core Game Loop) - different system focus areas

## Effort Estimate

**Story Points**: 8
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 days
**Complexity**: High

## Definition of Done

- Character creation has 100% success rate in all test scenarios
- All UI components render correctly and consistently
- UI updates reflect game state changes immediately
- View management handles all navigation cases
- Input system responds correctly to all user actions
- Performance meets responsive UI standards
- Cross-browser and device compatibility verified
- All UI tests pass including visual regression tests
- Code review completed and approved
- User experience is smooth and intuitive
