## Description

Repair the core game initialization, game loop, and state management systems. This task ensures the game starts properly, runs continuously without errors, and maintains consistent state throughout gameplay sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Game initialization completes successfully every time
- [ ] Game loop runs continuously without crashes or freezes
- [ ] State management maintains consistency across all game systems
- [ ] Event system processes events correctly and timely
- [ ] Startup sequence follows proper order and handles failures gracefully
- [ ] Game can pause/resume without state corruption
- [ ] Performance is optimized for long-running sessions
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable over extended periods

## Technical Details

### Core Game Loop Components
- **Initialization System**: Game startup and configuration loading
- **Main Game Loop**: Core update/render cycle management
- **State Manager**: Centralized game state handling
- **Event System**: Game event processing and propagation
- **Scheduler**: Task and update scheduling system

### Key Fix Areas
- Game initialization sequence and error handling
- Main loop timing and performance optimization
- State synchronization between systems
- Event queue processing and priority handling
- Resource loading and dependency management
- Save/load state integrity
- Memory management and cleanup

### Implementation Strategy
1. Analyze initialization failures from diagnostic tests
2. Fix game startup sequence and error recovery
3. Repair main game loop timing and stability
4. Ensure state management consistency
5. Fix event system processing and propagation
6. Optimize for performance and memory usage
7. Test with extended gameplay sessions

## Dependencies

**Depends on**: Task 002 (Fix Module System) - requires stable module infrastructure
**Can run parallel with**: Task 004 (Fix Character & UI) - different system areas

## Effort Estimate

**Story Points**: 13
**Time Estimate**: 5-6 days
**Complexity**: Very High

## Definition of Done

- Game initializes successfully in all test scenarios
- Game loop runs stable for extended periods (8+ hours)
- State management passes all consistency tests
- Event system handles all event types correctly
- Startup sequence is robust and handles edge cases
- Performance meets idle game requirements
- Memory usage is stable and optimized
- All core game loop tests pass
- Code review completed and approved
- Performance benchmarks documented
