# Task: Gameplay Validation

## Description

Run a complete simulation through all game content to validate that every mechanic works correctly from start to end-game. Test the full progression path including character creation, combat, crafting, resource management, and all advanced systems. Ensure the entire game experience is functional and enjoyable without any blocking issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete gameplay simulation runs from character creation to end-game without errors
- [ ] All combat encounters can be completed successfully
- [ ] Every crafting recipe can be executed with proper materials
- [ ] All shop transactions function correctly across all game stages
- [ ] Resource generation and consumption balance properly throughout progression
- [ ] All skills and abilities work as intended in their respective contexts
- [ ] Save/load functionality works at every tested progression point
- [ ] UI updates correctly reflect all game state changes
- [ ] All achievements unlock at appropriate milestones
- [ ] End-game content is accessible and functional

## Technical Details

### Automated Gameplay Simulation
- **Character Progression**: Simulate complete character development from level 1 to max level
- **Combat Testing**: Automated combat against all monster types and difficulty levels
- **Resource Management**: Test all resource generation, consumption, and balance scenarios
- **System Integration**: Validate that all game systems work together harmoniously

### Manual Validation Testing
- **User Experience**: Manual playthrough to validate game feel and progression pacing
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test unusual player behaviors and boundary conditions
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure smooth gameplay during extended sessions
- **Visual Validation**: Confirm all UI elements display correctly during gameplay

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Early Game**: Character creation, tutorial, initial progression (levels 1-10)
- **Mid Game**: Advanced mechanics, crafting, intermediate content (levels 10-50)
- **Late Game**: Complex systems, high-level content, optimization (levels 50-100)
- **End Game**: Maximum progression, final challenges, completion rewards

### Integration Validation
- **Cross-System Testing**: Verify all systems work together without conflicts
- **State Consistency**: Ensure game state remains consistent across all operations
- **Performance Testing**: Validate acceptable performance under all gameplay conditions
- **Data Persistence**: Test save/load at multiple points during the full progression

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Fresh character creation and initial progression
- Mid-game save/load and progression continuation
- Combat system under various conditions
- Crafting system with all available recipes
- Resource management during different game phases
- UI responsiveness during intensive operations

## Dependencies

- [ ] All previous tasks (001-006) must be completed
- [ ] Diagnostic test framework must be functional
- [ ] All core systems must be fixed and stable
- [ ] Game mechanics must be working correctly
- [ ] Save system must be reliable

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XL
- Hours: 40-48 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all previous fixes)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete end-to-end gameplay simulation passes without critical errors
- [ ] Manual validation confirms smooth and enjoyable gameplay experience
- [ ] All game systems demonstrate proper integration and functionality
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable throughout entire progression
- [ ] Save/load works reliably at all tested progression points
- [ ] No blocking bugs prevent game completion
- [ ] All achievements and progression milestones are reachable
- [ ] Game balance feels appropriate for intended progression curve
- [ ] Comprehensive test report documents all validated functionality
- [ ] Code review confirms production readiness of all game systems
