## Description

Build a comprehensive test framework with gameplay simulation to identify and document all current game errors. This task focuses on creating automated diagnostic tools that can systematically test all game components and provide detailed error reporting.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive test framework is implemented that covers all major game systems
- [ ] Gameplay simulation runs complete game cycles without manual intervention
- [ ] All current errors are documented with stack traces, reproduction steps, and severity levels
- [ ] Automated test runner provides clear pass/fail results for each game component
- [ ] Test results are exportable for analysis and tracking
- [ ] Performance metrics are captured during testing
- [ ] Memory leak detection is integrated
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing is included

## Technical Details

### Test Framework Components
- **Unit Testing**: Individual function and module testing
- **Integration Testing**: Component interaction testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Full gameplay flow simulation
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing capabilities
- **Error Reporting**: Structured logging and reporting system

### Key Test Areas
- Game initialization sequence
- Character creation and progression
- Resource generation and consumption
- UI rendering and updates
- Save/load functionality
- Event system operations
- Module loading and dependencies

### Implementation Strategy
1. Set up testing infrastructure with appropriate test runners
2. Create mock data generators for consistent test scenarios
3. Implement automated gameplay simulation
4. Build comprehensive error logging and reporting
5. Create performance monitoring tools
6. Establish baseline metrics for comparison

## Dependencies

This task has no dependencies and can run in parallel with other tasks.

## Effort Estimate

**Story Points**: 8
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 days
**Complexity**: High
