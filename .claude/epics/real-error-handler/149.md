### Implementation Standards
- **Real Browser Testing**: No mocked browser behavior
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All error scenarios and recovery paths
- **Performance Focused**: Actual timing and resource measurements
- **Production Realistic**: Tests mirror real-world usage patterns
- **Reliable**: Consistent results across multiple runs

### Test Categories

1. **Error Injection Tests**
   - Throw JavaScript errors at random intervals
   - Simulate network timeouts and failures
   - Create memory pressure and leaks
   - Corrupt local storage and game state
   - Trigger browser API failures

2. **Recovery Validation**
   - Verify automatic error recovery mechanisms
   - Test manual recovery through user actions
   - Validate state restoration accuracy
   - Confirm UI responsiveness during recovery
   - Measure recovery time performance

3. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Test real-time error display updates
   - Verify error filtering and search functionality
   - Validate error detail accuracy
   - Test developer mode activation/deactivation
   - Confirm analytics dashboard functionality

4. **Monitoring Accuracy**
   - Validate error detection and classification
   - Test performance metrics collection
   - Verify session tracking accuracy
   - Confirm report generation completeness
   - Test monitoring system overhead

5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - Error handling consistency across browsers
   - Performance impact variations
   - API compatibility and fallbacks
   - UI rendering consistency
   - Feature availability differences

### Playwright MCP Integration
- Use Playwright MCP for real browser automation
- Leverage browser developer tools integration
- Implement custom browser context setup
- Utilize network interception capabilities
- Employ screenshot and video recording

### Test Execution Strategy
1. **Smoke Tests**: Basic error handling functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation
3. **Performance Tests**: Resource usage and timing
4. **Stress Tests**: High error frequency scenarios
5. **Regression Tests**: Previous bug reproduction

## Validation Criteria
- All error injection scenarios execute successfully
- Recovery mechanisms work in 100% of test cases
- Dashboard displays accurate real-time data
- Monitoring system captures all injected errors
- Performance overhead remains within acceptable limits
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Test suite runs reliably in CI/CD environment
- No false positives or flaky test results

## Performance Benchmarks
- Error detection latency < 50ms
- Recovery initiation time < 200ms
