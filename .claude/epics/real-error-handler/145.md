## Overview
Enhance the existing SaveManager with automatic state checkpointing capabilities to enable reliable recovery from critical errors. Implement intelligent checkpoint creation, validation, and rollback mechanisms that preserve game progress while ensuring state integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Automatic Checkpoint System (MUST)
- [ ] Extend SaveManager.js with checkpoint functionality:
  - [ ] Automatic checkpoint creation at key game milestones
  - [ ] Time-based checkpoint intervals (configurable, default 5 minutes)
  - [ ] Event-driven checkpoints (level up, major purchases, etc.)
  - [ ] Critical operation checkpoints (before risky state changes)
- [ ] Checkpoint storage management:
  - [ ] Maintain 10 rolling checkpoints (configurable)
  - [ ] Compressed checkpoint storage to minimize space usage
  - [ ] Checksums for integrity validation
  - [ ] Async checkpoint operations to prevent UI blocking

### 2. Intelligent Checkpoint Strategy (MUST)
- [ ] Smart checkpoint timing:
  - [ ] Avoid checkpoints during rapid state changes
  - [ ] Priority checkpoints for stable game states
  - [ ] Checkpoint clustering prevention (minimum 30s intervals)
  - [ ] Performance-aware checkpoint scheduling
- [ ] State validation before checkpoint creation:
  - [ ] Verify game state integrity
  - [ ] Ensure all critical systems are in valid states
  - [ ] Validate numerical consistency (no NaN, Infinity values)
  - [ ] Check for circular references and memory leaks

### 3. Advanced Rollback Mechanisms (MUST)
- [ ] Multi-level rollback system:
  - [ ] Immediate rollback (last checkpoint)
  - [ ] Selective rollback (choose from available checkpoints)
  - [ ] Partial rollback (rollback specific game systems only)
  - [ ] Progressive rollback (try newer checkpoints first)
- [ ] Rollback safety measures:
  - [ ] Pre-rollback state backup
  - [ ] Rollback transaction logging
  - [ ] Rollback validation and verification
  - [ ] User confirmation for major rollbacks (>1 hour loss)

### 4. Integration with Error Recovery (MUST)
- [ ] Seamless integration with GameErrorHandler from Task 143:
  - [ ] Automatic checkpoint creation before error recovery attempts
  - [ ] Rollback triggers for irrecoverable errors
  - [ ] Post-recovery checkpoint validation
  - [ ] Recovery success metrics tracking
- [ ] Error-specific rollback strategies:
  - [ ] Save corruption: Rollback to last valid save
  - [ ] Memory errors: Rollback with memory cleanup
  - [ ] Calculation errors: Rollback affected systems only
  - [ ] UI errors: Preserve backend state, reset UI state

### 5. Performance and Storage Optimization (MUST)
- [ ] Efficient checkpoint storage:
  - [ ] Delta compression between checkpoints
  - [ ] Selective state checkpointing (exclude UI state, temporary data)
  - [ ] Background checkpoint processing
  - [ ] Storage quota management and cleanup
- [ ] Performance requirements:
  - [ ] Checkpoint creation <100ms for normal game states
  - [ ] Rollback operation <500ms
  - [ ] Memory overhead <2MB for checkpoint system
  - [ ] No frame rate impact during checkpoint operations

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify
1. **Modify**: `js/core/SaveManager.js` - Add checkpointing functionality
2. **Create**: `js/core/CheckpointManager.js` - Dedicated checkpoint logic
3. **Create**: `js/core/StateValidator.js` - State integrity validation
4. **Modify**: `js/core/GameErrorHandler.js` - Integrate rollback triggers
5. **Create**: `tests/checkpointing.test.js` - Comprehensive test suite

### Checkpoint Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: 'checkpoint_1634567890123',
  timestamp: 1634567890123,
  gameVersion: '1.0.0',
  checksum: 'sha256_hash',
  triggerType: 'AUTO' | 'MILESTONE' | 'MANUAL' | 'ERROR_RECOVERY',

  // Core game state
  playerState: { ... },
  gameState: { ... },
  systemStates: { ... },

  // Metadata
  validation: {
    isValid: true,
    checks: ['integrity', 'consistency', 'completeness'],
    errors: []
  },

  // Compression info
  compressed: true,
  originalSize: 1024576,
  compressedSize: 204800
}
```

### Checkpoint Strategy Configuration
```javascript
const checkpointConfig = {
  intervals: {
    auto: 300000,        // 5 minutes
    milestone: 'event',  // On significant events
    error: 'immediate'   // Before error recovery
  },

  retention: {
    count: 10,           // Keep 10 checkpoints
    maxAge: 86400000,    // 24 hours max age
    criticalKeep: 3      // Always keep 3 critical checkpoints
  },

  validation: {
    enabled: true,
    strictMode: false,   // Allow minor inconsistencies
    autoRepair: true     // Attempt automatic repairs
  }
}
```

### Rollback Implementation
```javascript
class CheckpointManager {
  async rollbackToCheckpoint(checkpointId, options = {}) {
    const checkpoint = await this.getCheckpoint(checkpointId);

    // Pre-rollback validation
    if (!this.validateCheckpoint(checkpoint)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid checkpoint for rollback');
    }

    // Create rollback backup
    const rollbackBackup = await this.createRollbackBackup();

    try {
      // Perform rollback
      await this.restoreState(checkpoint);
      await this.validateRestoredState();

      // Log successful rollback
      this.logRollback(checkpoint, 'SUCCESS');

    } catch (error) {
      // Rollback failed, restore backup
      await this.restoreFromBackup(rollbackBackup);
      throw new Error('Rollback failed: ' + error.message);
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Playwright MCP Tests
1. **Checkpoint Creation Tests**: Verify automatic and manual checkpoint creation
2. **Rollback Tests**: Test rollback functionality under various scenarios
3. **Performance Tests**: Measure checkpoint/rollback performance impact
4. **Storage Tests**: Validate checkpoint storage and cleanup
5. **Integration Tests**: Test with error recovery system
6. **Corruption Tests**: Test behavior with corrupted checkpoints

### Checkpoint Scenarios
1. **Normal Operation**: Regular gameplay with automatic checkpoints
2. **Error Recovery**: Rollback after save corruption detection
3. **Performance Stress**: Checkpoint behavior under high load
4. **Storage Limits**: Behavior when approaching storage limits
5. **Multiple Sessions**: Checkpoint consistency across browser sessions

### Validation Tests
- State integrity before and after checkpoints
- Numerical consistency validation
- Memory leak detection in checkpoint data
- Rollback accuracy (restored state matches checkpoint)

## Success Metrics
- Checkpoint creation success rate >99.9%
- Rollback success rate >99% for valid checkpoints
- Performance impact <5ms per frame during checkpoint operations
- Storage efficiency: >60% compression ratio
- Zero data loss in rollback scenarios during testing

## Dependencies
- **Task 143**: Requires GameErrorHandler integration for rollback triggers
- Existing SaveManager.js implementation must be functional

## Parallel Execution
- Can be developed in parallel with Tasks 144 and 146
- Requires coordination with Task 143 for integration points

## Notes
- Create ACTUAL working implementations using Write/MultiEdit tools
- Focus on real checkpoint and rollback functionality, not mock implementations
- Test extensively with Playwright MCP in real browser environment
- Ensure checkpoint system doesn't degrade game performance
- Design for extensibility - other systems should easily integrate checkpointing
- Consider checkpoint encryption for sensitive game state data
