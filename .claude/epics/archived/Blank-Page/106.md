# Task: Implement Fallback Character Creation

## Description
Make character creation work independently of complex game modules using simple DOM events and polling-based state detection. This ensures users can create characters even when advanced systems fail to load properly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Character creation works with simple onclick handlers
- [ ] No dependencies on complex event systems or modules
- [ ] Button enabling uses polling-based state detection
- [ ] Form validation works without advanced frameworks
- [ ] Character data persists to localStorage as fallback
- [ ] Graceful transition to full system when available

## Technical Details
Implementation approach focuses on simplicity and reliability:
- Replace complex event bindings with simple onclick attributes
- Use setInterval for polling button states instead of reactive updates
- Direct DOM manipulation for form interactions
- localStorage for immediate character data persistence
- Progressive enhancement when full game systems load
- Key files: character-creation.html, js/character-fallback.js

## Dependencies
- [ ] None for this task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
