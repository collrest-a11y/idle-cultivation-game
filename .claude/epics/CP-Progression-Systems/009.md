# Task: Integration & Polish

## Description
Complete the final integration of all progression systems with comprehensive balancing, visual effects, tutorial integration, achievement hooks, and overall polish. Ensure all systems work together harmoniously and provide the target 40-50% CP contribution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All progression systems integrated into PowerCalculator
- [ ] Comprehensive balancing to achieve 40-50% total CP contribution
- [ ] Visual effects and animations for all progression systems
- [ ] Tutorial integration for each system unlock
- [ ] Achievement system integration for progression milestones
- [ ] Performance optimization for all systems
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness for all progression UIs
- [ ] Save system migration for existing players
- [ ] Error handling and graceful degradation

## Technical Details
- Final PowerCalculator integration testing
- Performance optimization across all systems
- Visual effects implementation for progression actions
- Tutorial system integration
- Achievement milestone integration
- Mobile UI optimization
- Save system compatibility testing

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks (002-008) must be completed
- [ ] Existing tutorial system for integration
- [ ] Achievement system for milestone integration
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools

## Effort Estimate
