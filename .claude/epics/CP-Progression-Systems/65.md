# Task: Core Framework Implementation

## Description
Implement the foundational architecture for all progression systems including base classes, interfaces, PowerCalculator extensions, and GameState schema updates. This forms the foundation that all other progression systems will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Base ProgressionSystem class implemented with common interface
- [ ] EnhancementSystem class for equipment-based systems (mounts, wings, accessories)
- [ ] CultivationSystem class for cultivation-based systems (meridians, dantian, soul)
- [ ] PowerCalculator extended with PROGRESSION_FORMULAS for all system types
- [ ] GameState schema updated with progression system state branches
- [ ] MaterialManager class for handling progression-specific materials
- [ ] Realm-based unlock system integrated with cultivation progression
- [ ] EventManager integration for progression system events

## Technical Details
- Create `src/core/progression/` directory structure
- Implement base classes in `src/core/progression/ProgressionSystem.js`
- Extend `src/core/PowerCalculator.js` with progression formulas
- Update `src/core/GameState.js` with new state branches
- Create `src/core/progression/MaterialManager.js`
- Integration points with existing EventManager

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing PowerCalculator system
- [ ] Existing GameState architecture
- [ ] Existing EventManager system
- [ ] Cultivation realm progression system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (foundation for all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full functionality
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (90%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests with existing systems
- [ ] Documentation updated for new architecture
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] All base classes ready for system implementations
