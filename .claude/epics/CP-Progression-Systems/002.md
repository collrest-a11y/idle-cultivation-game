# Task: Mount System Implementation

## Description
Implement the complete mount system including data models, feeding mechanics, bonding progression, evolution paths, and the mount stable UI. This system provides idle progression through mount care and training.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Mount data structures with tier/level/bond progression
- [ ] Mount feeding mechanics with material consumption
- [ ] Bonding system with idle progression
- [ ] Mount evolution paths and requirements
- [ ] Mount stable UI with management interface
- [ ] Mount feeding interface with drag-drop
- [ ] Mount stats display and CP contribution visualization
- [ ] Mount unlock system based on cultivation realm
- [ ] Integration with existing gacha system for mount acquisition

## Technical Details
- Implement `src/systems/progression/MountSystem.js`
- Create mount data templates in `src/data/mounts/`
- Build `src/components/progression/MountStableView.js`
- Mount bonding mechanics with time-based progression
- Evolution system with material requirements
- CP calculation integration via PowerCalculator

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Core Framework) must be completed
- [ ] Existing gacha system for mount acquisition
- [ ] Material system for feeding and evolution
- [ ] Cultivation realm system for unlocks

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside wings and accessories)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Mount system fully functional with all mechanics
- [ ] Complete UI for mount management
- [ ] Tests written and passing for all mount functionality
- [ ] Integration with PowerCalculator verified
- [ ] Mount progression balancing completed
- [ ] Documentation and user guides updated
