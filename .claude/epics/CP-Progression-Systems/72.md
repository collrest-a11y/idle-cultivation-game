# Task: Soul & Constellation Systems

## Description
Implement the advanced soul cultivation and constellation alignment systems with soul manifestation, star chart navigation, celestial alignment mechanics, and their respective UIs. These represent the most transcendent progression systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Soul cultivation system with manifestation mechanics
- [ ] Soul realm progression and soul power calculation
- [ ] Constellation system with star chart navigation
- [ ] Celestial alignment mechanics with timing elements
- [ ] Soul realm UI with manifestation visualization
- [ ] Constellation chart UI with interactive star map
- [ ] CP contribution from soul and constellation power
- [ ] Integration with highest cultivation realms
- [ ] Advanced unlock requirements and prerequisites

## Technical Details
- Implement `src/systems/progression/SoulSystem.js`
