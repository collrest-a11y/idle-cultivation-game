# Task: Dantian Cultivation System

## Description
Implement the dantian energy center cultivation system with chamber expansion, energy concentration mechanics, and cultivation chamber UI. This system focuses on internal energy cultivation and storage expansion.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dantian data structures with energy center management
- [ ] Chamber expansion mechanics with size progression
- [ ] Energy concentration and purification systems
- [ ] Dantian chamber UI with energy visualization
- [ ] Progressive unlock based on cultivation advancement
- [ ] Multiple dantian types (lower, middle, upper)
- [ ] CP contribution from dantian development
- [ ] Integration with existing qi generation systems
- [ ] Idle cultivation mechanics for continuous growth

## Technical Details
- Implement `src/systems/progression/DantianSystem.js`
- Create dantian data templates in `src/data/dantian/`
- Build `src/components/progression/DantianChamberView.js`
- Energy concentration mechanics with time progression
- Chamber expansion with material requirements
- Multiple dantian management system

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Core Framework) must be completed
- [ ] Existing cultivation and qi systems
- [ ] Material system for chamber expansion
- [ ] Cultivation realm progression for unlocks

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 14-18 hours
- Parallel: true (independent cultivation system)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Dantian system fully implemented with all mechanics
- [ ] Complete cultivation chamber UI with energy effects
- [ ] Tests written and passing for dantian functionality
- [ ] Integration with qi systems verified
- [ ] Dantian progression balancing completed
- [ ] Idle cultivation mechanics working properly
