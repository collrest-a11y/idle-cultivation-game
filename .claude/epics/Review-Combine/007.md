# Task: Integration Dashboard & Monitoring

## Description
Extend existing dashboard with real-time integration health, test results, and performance metrics. Build comprehensive monitoring interface that leverages current dashboard framework to provide visibility into cross-system integration status, performance tracking, and validation results across all 12 MMORPG systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time integration health dashboard extending existing UI components
- [ ] Test result visualization showing cross-system validation status
- [ ] Performance metrics display for 60fps and sub-10ms operation tracking
- [ ] Error reporting interface with integration-specific error categorization
- [ ] Live monitoring of event propagation across all systems
- [ ] Integration status API endpoints extending current health check infrastructure
- [ ] Dashboard responsive design working on all device sizes
- [ ] Real-time updates using existing WebSocket infrastructure

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Extend existing dashboard components with integration-specific views
- Key considerations: Reuse current chart/graph components, leverage existing event system for real-time updates
- Code locations/files affected: Dashboard components, performance monitoring UI, health check APIs
- UI framework: Build on existing UI component library and dashboard infrastructure
- Data flow: Extend current performance monitoring with integration metrics aggregation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 001-006 completed (integration test framework and validation suites)
- [ ] Existing dashboard framework and UI component library
- [ ] Current performance monitoring infrastructure (PerformanceMonitor.js)
- [ ] Existing WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates
- [ ] Current health check API endpoints

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: false (needs test results from previous tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Integration dashboard implemented extending existing UI framework
- [ ] Real-time monitoring functional with sub-second update frequency
- [ ] Performance metrics accurately tracking all 12 systems
- [ ] Error reporting categorizing integration vs system-specific issues
- [ ] Dashboard accessible and functional across all supported devices
- [ ] API endpoints documented and providing comprehensive integration status
- [ ] Monitoring data persisted for historical analysis and trending
