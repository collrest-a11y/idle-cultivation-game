## Description

Extend the existing test infrastructure to support comprehensive cross-system validation capabilities for the idle cultivation game. This foundational task enables thorough testing of interactions between all 12 MMORPG systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Extend Jest configuration for cross-system test scenarios
- [ ] Create test utilities for multi-system state management
- [ ] Implement test database with realistic cultivation data
- [ ] Add fixtures for complex game state scenarios
- [ ] Create helpers for system interaction validation
- [ ] Document testing patterns for cross-system flows
- [ ] Ensure test isolation and cleanup between scenarios

## Technical Requirements

### Test Infrastructure Extensions
- Enhance existing Jest setup with cross-system capabilities
- Create test utilities for managing complex game states
- Implement database seeding for realistic test scenarios
- Add performance testing capabilities for idle calculations

### Cross-System Validation Tools
- State snapshot and comparison utilities
- Event tracking and validation helpers
- Data integrity verification tools
- System interaction monitoring

### Documentation
- Testing patterns guide for cross-system scenarios
- Best practices for integration test development
- Setup and configuration documentation

## Implementation Notes

- Build upon existing test infrastructure rather than replacing
- Focus on reusable utilities that support all system combinations
- Ensure tests can run in isolation and in parallel
- Consider performance implications of complex test scenarios

## Dependencies

None - This is a foundational task that enables other testing tasks.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed
- [ ] Test infrastructure successfully validates cross-system scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated with new testing patterns
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
