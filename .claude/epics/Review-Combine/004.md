## Description

Extend the existing PerformanceMonitor.js and UIOptimizer.js systems to validate that performance targets (60fps, sub-10ms operations) are maintained when all 12 MMORPG systems are active simultaneously. This task ensures the integrated system meets production performance standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Extend PerformanceMonitor.js for cross-system performance tracking
- [ ] Create performance test scenarios with all systems active
- [ ] Validate 60fps target maintained during complex operations
- [ ] Verify sub-10ms response times for critical game actions
- [ ] Implement performance regression detection
- [ ] Add real-time performance dashboards for integration testing
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for idle calculation loops
- [ ] Document performance optimization guidelines

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Monitoring Extensions
- Enhance existing PerformanceMonitor.js with integration-specific metrics
- Add system-by-system performance breakdown tracking
- Implement frame rate monitoring during multi-system operations
- Create response time validation for cross-system interactions

### Test Scenarios
- All 12 systems active simultaneously
- Peak load scenarios (hunting + crafting + trading + VIP)
- Long-running idle calculations with full system integration
- Save/load operations with complex multi-system state

### Performance Targets
- Maintain 60fps during all integrated operations
- Sub-10ms response times for critical user actions
- Memory usage within acceptable bounds during extended play
- CPU usage optimization for idle calculation loops

## Implementation Notes

- Build upon existing PerformanceMonitor.js infrastructure
- Leverage current UIOptimizer.js patterns for performance optimization
- Focus on identifying performance bottlenecks in system interactions
- Ensure monitoring doesn't significantly impact performance itself

## Dependencies

- Task 001: Integration Test Framework Setup (required for test infrastructure)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed
- [ ] Performance monitoring validates 60fps and sub-10ms targets
- [ ] Integration scenarios pass performance benchmarks
- [ ] Real-time performance dashboard operational
- [ ] Performance regression detection active
- [ ] Documentation updated with optimization guidelines
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] All existing performance tests continue to pass
