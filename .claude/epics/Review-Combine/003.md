## Description

Validate data integrity and event propagation across all 12 MMORPG systems to ensure consistent state management and proper system interactions. This comprehensive validation ensures that complex multi-system operations maintain data consistency and proper event flows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Data flow mapping for all 12 systems and their interactions
- [ ] Event propagation validation across system boundaries
- [ ] Data consistency checks for complex multi-system operations
- [ ] State synchronization validation for real-time features
- [ ] Database integrity checks for cross-system references
- [ ] Cache consistency validation across all layers
- [ ] Error handling validation for failed cross-system operations
- [ ] Performance impact assessment of cross-system validations

## Technical Requirements

### System Interaction Validation
- **Character System** ↔ All other systems (stats, progression, inventory)
- **Combat System** ↔ Character, Guild, Leaderboard, Achievement systems
- **Guild System** ↔ Character, Chat, Event, Leaderboard systems
- **Market System** ↔ Character, Inventory, Currency, Notification systems
- **Quest System** ↔ Character, Achievement, Inventory, Progression systems

### Data Integrity Checks
- Foreign key constraint validation
- Referential integrity across system boundaries
- State consistency during concurrent operations
- Transaction rollback scenarios
- Data migration and versioning validation

### Event Flow Validation
- WebSocket event propagation timing
- Database trigger execution validation
- Cache invalidation cascade verification
- Notification delivery confirmation
- Real-time update synchronization

### Performance Monitoring
- Cross-system operation latency tracking
- Database query optimization validation
- Cache hit rate monitoring
- Memory usage during complex operations

## Implementation Notes

- Use the extended test framework from Task 001
- Create comprehensive test scenarios covering all system combinations
- Implement automated data consistency monitoring
- Focus on realistic game scenarios that stress multiple systems
- Include edge cases and error conditions

## Dependencies

- Task 001 (Integration Test Framework Setup) must be completed first
