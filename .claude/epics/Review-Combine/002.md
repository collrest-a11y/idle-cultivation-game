## Description

Create a comprehensive end-to-end testing suite using MCP Playwright to validate all critical user workflows in the idle cultivation game. This ensures the complete user experience works correctly across all systems and interfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Playwright setup integrated with MCP capabilities
- [ ] Core cultivation workflow tests (breakthrough, resource gathering, skill progression)
- [ ] Combat system integration tests (PvP, PvE, tournament flows)
- [ ] Guild and social system tests (creation, management, events)
- [ ] Market and trading system tests (auctions, direct trades, pricing)
- [ ] Quest and achievement system tests (completion flows, rewards)
- [ ] Real-time features tests (WebSocket events, live updates)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validation across all workflows
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for critical user paths

## Technical Requirements

### Playwright Configuration
- MCP Playwright integration setup
- Multi-browser testing configuration (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile device emulation for React Native compatibility
- Custom test fixtures for cultivation game scenarios

### Critical User Workflows
- **New Player Onboarding**: Account creation through first breakthrough
- **Daily Cultivation Loop**: Resource gathering, skill training, breakthrough attempts
- **Combat Engagement**: PvP matches, dungeon runs, tournament participation
- **Social Interaction**: Guild joining, chat, collaborative events
- **Economic Activity**: Market browsing, trading, auction participation
- **Progression Tracking**: Achievement unlocks, leaderboard updates

### Performance Validation
- Page load times for complex game states
- Real-time update responsiveness
- Long-running idle calculation accuracy
- Memory usage during extended sessions

## Implementation Notes

- Leverage MCP Playwright for enhanced browser automation
- Create reusable page objects for game interfaces
- Implement test data management for realistic scenarios
- Focus on user-centric test scenarios rather than technical edge cases
- Include visual regression testing for UI consistency

## Dependencies

- Task 001 (Integration Test Framework Setup) must be completed first

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed
- [ ] Playwright suite covers all critical user workflows
- [ ] Tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and documented
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Test maintenance documentation provided
