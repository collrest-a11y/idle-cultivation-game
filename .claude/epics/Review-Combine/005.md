## Description

Implement comprehensive validation of economic flows across all interconnected systems to ensure balance integrity and prevent exploitation. This task validates that the economic balance system works correctly when all 12 MMORPG systems interact, maintaining proper resource flows and preventing economic exploits.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Validate CP flow integrity across all systems
- [ ] Test anti-exploitation measures for economic interactions
- [ ] Verify resource generation and consumption balance
- [ ] Validate trading system economic safeguards
- [ ] Test market system price stability mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure VIP system economic balance integration
- [ ] Verify crafting system resource cost accuracy
- [ ] Test hunting system reward distribution balance
- [ ] Validate equipment system upgrade cost integrity
- [ ] Document economic flow patterns and safeguards

## Technical Requirements

### Economic Flow Validation
- Cross-system CP transaction integrity testing
- Resource generation vs consumption balance verification
- Multi-system economic interaction simulation
- Long-term economic stability modeling

### Anti-Exploitation Testing
- Automated exploit detection scenarios
- Resource duplication prevention validation
- Price manipulation resistance testing
- Multi-system timing attack prevention

### Balance Verification
- Equipment upgrade cost progression validation
- Hunting reward vs effort balance testing
- Crafting material cost optimization verification
- Trading system fee structure validation
- VIP benefit economic impact assessment

### Integration Scenarios
- Complex multi-system economic transactions
- Simultaneous trading, crafting, and hunting operations
- Market fluctuation impact on all connected systems
- Save/load state economic data integrity

## Implementation Notes

- Leverage existing economic balance system infrastructure
- Build upon current anti-exploitation measures
- Focus on cross-system economic interaction edge cases
- Ensure testing covers both normal and stress scenarios
- Consider long-term economic stability implications

## Dependencies

- Task 001: Integration Test Framework Setup (required for test infrastructure)
