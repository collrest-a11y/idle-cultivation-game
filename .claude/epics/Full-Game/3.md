# Save System & Data Persistence

## Description

Implement a robust save system that handles data persistence, versioning, and migration for the idle cultivation game. This system must ensure player progress is never lost and can handle schema changes gracefully as the game evolves.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] LocalStorage wrapper with compression and error handling
- [ ] Automatic save system with configurable intervals
- [ ] Manual save/load functionality with user feedback
- [ ] Save data versioning with migration system
- [ ] Data validation and corruption recovery
- [ ] Import/export functionality for save sharing
- [ ] Multiple save slot support
- [ ] Save data encryption for tamper prevention
- [ ] Backup system with recovery options

## Technical Details

### Storage Layer
- LocalStorage wrapper with fallback to in-memory storage
- LZ-string compression to maximize storage efficiency
- Chunked storage for large save files
- Storage quota monitoring and management
- Graceful degradation when storage is unavailable

### Save Data Structure
```typescript
interface SaveData {
  version: string;
  timestamp: number;
  checksum: string;
  gameState: GameStateSnapshot;
  metadata: SaveMetadata;
}
```

### Versioning & Migration
- Semantic versioning for save compatibility
- Migration functions for each version transition
- Rollback capability for failed migrations
- Schema validation before and after migration
- Migration progress reporting for large saves

### Auto-Save System
- Configurable save intervals (default: 30 seconds)
- Trigger-based saves on significant events
- Background saving to prevent UI blocking
- Save queue management for rapid changes
- Error recovery and retry logic

### Data Integrity
- CRC32 checksums for corruption detection
- Save validation against game schema
- Automatic backup before risky operations
- Recovery mode for corrupted saves
- Data sanitization and repair utilities

## Dependencies

- **2 (Core Game Engine & State Management)**: Requires GameState for save snapshots and event system for save triggers

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (2-3 days)**

- Day 1: Storage layer and basic save/load functionality
- Day 2: Versioning, migration system, and data validation
- Day 3: Auto-save, error handling, and advanced features

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete save/load cycle working with GameState integration
- [ ] Migration system tested with at least 3 version transitions
- [ ] Auto-save functioning with configurable intervals
- [ ] Data corruption scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Import/export working with proper validation
- [ ] Unit tests covering all save/load scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests for large save files (>1MB)
- [ ] Documentation for save format and migration system
- [ ] User-facing error messages clear and actionable
- [ ] Save integrity verified through extensive testing
