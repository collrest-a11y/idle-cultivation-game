# Combat System & Dueling

## Description

Implement a comprehensive turn-based combat system that allows players to engage in duels with other cultivators, NPCs, and participate in tournaments. The system should calculate combat power based on cultivation level, techniques, and equipment, providing strategic depth while maintaining the idle game progression philosophy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Turn-based combat engine with action queuing system
- [ ] Power calculation algorithm incorporating cultivation, techniques, and equipment
- [ ] Combat log displaying detailed action descriptions and outcomes
- [ ] Victory/defeat mechanics with appropriate rewards and penalties
- [ ] Player vs Player (PvP) dueling system with matchmaking
- [ ] Player vs Environment (PvE) encounters and boss battles
- [ ] Combat ranking system with leaderboards
- [ ] Tournament brackets and scheduled competitions
- [ ] Combat techniques with cooldowns and resource costs
- [ ] Equipment effects and bonuses during combat
- [ ] Spectator mode for watching other players' duels

## Technical Details

### Combat Engine Architecture
- State machine managing combat phases (preparation, action, resolution, cleanup)
- Action queue system with priority ordering
- Turn timer system with auto-actions for idle players
- Combat state persistence for offline progression
- Real-time combat synchronization for PvP

### Power Calculation System
- Base power from cultivation level and realm
- Technique modifiers and mastery bonuses
- Equipment power contributions and set bonuses
- Elemental advantages and disadvantages
- Critical hit and dodge chance calculations
- Power scaling curves to maintain balance across realms

### Combat Mechanics
- Initiative system determining action order
- Action types: Attack, Defend, Technique, Item, Retreat
- Status effects and debuffs with duration tracking
- Combo system for chaining techniques
- Environmental factors affecting combat outcomes
- Experience and loot distribution based on performance

### Matchmaking & Rankings
- ELO-based rating system for balanced matchmaking
- Tier-based rankings with seasonal resets
- Combat history tracking and statistics
- Tournament bracket generation and management
- Spectator system with real-time updates

## Dependencies

- **2 - Core Game Engine**: Required for state management and event system
- **5 - Cultivation System**: Required for power calculations and progression integration

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (2-3 days)**

- Day 1: Combat engine foundation and power calculation algorithms
- Day 2: PvP system, matchmaking, and basic tournament structure
- Day 3: Combat UI, rankings, spectator mode, and testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Combat system fully integrated with cultivation and equipment systems
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for all combat calculations and mechanics
- [ ] PvP matchmaking functional with balanced opponent selection
- [ ] Tournament system operational with bracket generation and progression
- [ ] Combat UI responsive and provides clear feedback to players
- [ ] Performance testing confirms smooth operation during concurrent combats
- [ ] Balance testing validates power scaling across all cultivation realms
- [ ] Documentation covering combat mechanics and API integration
- [ ] Error handling prevents exploitation and ensures fair play
- [ ] Real-time synchronization working reliably for PvP encounters
