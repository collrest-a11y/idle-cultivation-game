# Base UI Framework & Components

## Description

Create a foundational UI framework and essential components that provide the building blocks for all game interfaces. This system will establish the visual language, responsive behavior, and reusable components needed throughout the cultivation game.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] BaseComponent class with lifecycle management and event handling
- [ ] Modal system with overlay, focus management, and animations
- [ ] TabContainer for organizing content with persistent state
- [ ] ProgressBar with customizable styles and animations
- [ ] Responsive grid layout system
- [ ] Theme system supporting Girls' Frontline aesthetic
- [ ] Animation utilities and easing functions
- [ ] Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design patterns

## Technical Details

### BaseComponent Architecture
```typescript
abstract class BaseComponent {
  protected element: HTMLElement;
  protected state: ComponentState;
  protected eventBus: EventBus;

  abstract render(): void;
  abstract destroy(): void;

  protected onMount(): void;
  protected onUpdate(): void;
  protected onUnmount(): void;
}
```

### Component Library
- **Modal**: Configurable overlays with backdrop, animations, and focus trapping
- **TabContainer**: Multi-tab interface with lazy loading and state persistence
- **ProgressBar**: Animated progress indicators with multiple visual styles
- **Button**: Themed buttons with states (normal, hover, active, disabled)
- **Card**: Container component with consistent spacing and styling
- **Tooltip**: Contextual help system with smart positioning

### Layout System
- CSS Grid-based responsive layout
- Breakpoint system for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Flex utilities for common layouts
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness
- Spacing utilities with consistent scale

### Theme Integration
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Girls' Frontline color palette and typography
- Component variants for different contexts
- Dark/light mode support preparation
- Animation presets matching game aesthetic

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels and roles on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- Color contrast compliance
- Reduced motion preferences support

## Dependencies

- **2 (Core Game Engine & State Management)**: Requires event system for component communication and state management for UI state

## Effort Estimate

**Size: L (3-4 days)**

- Day 1: BaseComponent architecture and core utilities
- Day 2: Modal, TabContainer, and ProgressBar components
- Day 3: Layout system, theming, and responsive design
- Day 4: Accessibility, animations, and comprehensive testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All base components implemented with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Responsive design tested across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Theme system functional with Girls' Frontline styling applied
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed with screen reader testing
- [ ] Component documentation with live examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for component rendering and animations
- [ ] Unit tests for all component functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with GameState and event system
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile touch interactions working smoothly
