## Technical Details

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Performance tracking system
class PerformanceMonitor {
  constructor() {
    this.metrics = {
      frameRate: [],
      memoryUsage: [],
      calculationTime: [],
      renderTime: []
    };
  }

  trackOperation(name, operation) {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    const result = operation();
    const endTime = performance.now();

    this.metrics[name] = this.metrics[name] || [];
    this.metrics[name].push(endTime - startTime);

    return result;
  }
}
```

### Balance Configuration
- Centralized balance configuration files
- Easy tuning of progression parameters
- A/B testing framework for balance changes
- Analytics integration for balance monitoring

### Quality Assurance Framework
- Automated testing suite expansion
- Performance regression testing
- Memory leak detection tools
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Optimization Targets
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps during active play
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for extended sessions
- **Load Time**: < 3 seconds initial game load
- **Battery Impact**: Minimal drain during idle play
- **Responsiveness**: < 100ms UI interaction response
