# Scripture Collection & Gacha

## Description

Implement a comprehensive scripture collection and gacha system that serves as a core progression and monetization mechanic. Players can discover, collect, and enhance cultivation scriptures through various gacha mechanics, each providing unique bonuses and unlocking different cultivation paths. The system must balance excitement of discovery with fair progression for all players.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete scripture database with rarity tiers, attributes, and unique effects
- [ ] Multiple gacha pools: basic, premium, event-limited, and faction-specific
- [ ] Gacha mechanics with pity systems, rate-up events, and guaranteed rewards
- [ ] Scripture enhancement system: leveling, awakening, and breakthrough
- [ ] Collection management: inventory, sorting, filtering, and favorites
- [ ] Scripture synergy system for set bonuses and combination effects
- [ ] Duplicate scripture handling with conversion to enhancement materials
- [ ] Achievement system for collection milestones and rare discoveries
- [ ] Visual showcase system for displaying prized scriptures

## Technical Details

### Scripture Data Architecture
- Base `Scripture` class with inheritance for different types and rarities
- Comprehensive attribute system: cultivation bonuses, special effects, requirements
- Rarity tiers: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythical
- Scripture categories: Qi techniques, Body techniques, Dual cultivation, Support
- Dynamic stat calculation based on level, awakening, and enhancement state

### Gacha System Implementation
- Configurable gacha pools with weighted probability distributions
- Pity system implementation with soft and hard pity mechanics
- Rate-up event framework for temporary increased drop rates
- Multi-pull optimizations with guaranteed minimum rarity distributions
- Gacha history tracking for transparency and debugging

### Enhancement Mechanics
- Scripture leveling using experience materials and spiritual stones
- Awakening system unlocking additional stat lines and effects
- Breakthrough mechanics for transcending rarity limitations
- Enhancement success/failure rates with protection mechanisms
- Resource cost scaling based on scripture rarity and current level

### Collection Management System
- Advanced filtering: rarity, type, level, enhancement state, acquisition date
- Sorting algorithms: power rating, rarity, level, alphabetical, acquisition order
- Favorites system with custom tags and notes
- Mass operations: bulk enhancement, selling, filtering
- Collection statistics and completion tracking

### Synergy and Set Systems
- Set bonus definitions for scriptures from same schools or themes
- Dynamic synergy calculation based on equipped scripture combinations
- Visual indicators for active synergies and potential combinations
- Recommendation engine for optimal scripture loadouts
- Conflict resolution for overlapping effects

## Dependencies

- **2 - Core Game Engine**: Requires GameState for scripture data and event system
- **3 - Save/Load System**: Essential for scripture collection persistence

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (2-3 days)**

- Day 1: Scripture data models and basic gacha mechanics
- Day 2: Enhancement system and collection management
- Day 3: Synergy system, UI integration, and balance testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete scripture database with at least 200 unique scriptures across all rarities
- [ ] Gacha system with fair probability distributions and transparent pity mechanics
- [ ] Enhancement system providing meaningful progression for all scripture rarities
- [ ] Collection management supporting large inventories (1000+ scriptures) efficiently
- [ ] Synergy system encouraging strategic scripture combinations
- [ ] Duplicate handling system that feels rewarding rather than punishing
- [ ] Achievement system recognizing collection milestones and rare acquisitions
- [ ] Performance optimization for gacha animations and large collection operations
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests covering all gacha probabilities and edge cases
- [ ] Balance testing ensures fair progression for both paying and free players
- [ ] Integration tests demonstrate proper save/load of scripture collections
- [ ] Documentation includes gacha rates, enhancement formulas, and synergy mechanics
- [ ] Accessibility features for colorblind players and clear rarity indicators
