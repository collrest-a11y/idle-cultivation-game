# Game Views & Screen Implementation

## Description

Implement all major game screens and views using the established UI framework. Create dedicated views for cultivation, scripture study, combat, sect management, and quest tracking. Ensure seamless navigation between screens and consistent visual design throughout the game.

## Acceptance Criteria

### CultivationView Implementation
- [ ] Display current cultivation realm and progress
- [ ] Show energy/qi levels and regeneration rates
- [ ] Implement breakthrough interface with requirements
- [ ] Display cultivation techniques and their effects
- [ ] Show cultivation history and achievements

### ScriptureView Implementation
- [ ] Display available scriptures with rarity indicators
- [ ] Show study progress and completion status
- [ ] Implement scripture effects and bonuses display
- [ ] Create scripture collection and library interface
- [ ] Show scripture study queue and automation

### CombatView Implementation
- [ ] Display current combat status and opponent
- [ ] Show combat statistics and damage calculations
- [ ] Implement combat log with detailed action history
- [ ] Display loot and rewards from victories
- [ ] Show combat power and equipment effects

### SectView Implementation
- [ ] Display sect information and player rank
- [ ] Show sect missions and contribution requirements
- [ ] Implement sect shop with contribution exchange
- [ ] Display sect member rankings and interactions
- [ ] Show sect benefits and cultivation bonuses

### QuestView Implementation
- [ ] Display active and available quests
- [ ] Show quest progress and requirements
- [ ] Implement quest rewards and completion interface
- [ ] Display quest history and achievements
- [ ] Show quest chains and story progression

### Navigation & UI Polish
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions between views
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Ensure responsive design across all screens
- [ ] Implement consistent styling and theming
- [ ] Add tooltips and help text throughout

## Technical Details

### View Architecture
```javascript
// Base view structure
class GameView extends UIComponent {
  constructor(viewType) {
    super();
    this.viewType = viewType;
    this.isActive = false;
  }

  activate() {
    this.isActive = true;
    this.render();
    this.bindEvents();
  }

  deactivate() {
    this.isActive = false;
    this.unbindEvents();
  }
}
```

### View Manager
- Central view management system
- Handles view transitions and state
- Manages view lifecycle and cleanup
- Implements view caching for performance

### Component Integration
- Leverage existing UI components from task 4
- Ensure consistent styling with Girls' Frontline theme
- Implement proper data binding and updates
- Use established event system for interactions

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load view content when activated
- Implement efficient data updates
- Cache frequently accessed view data
- Optimize rendering for long-running sessions

## Dependencies

### Required Systems
- **UI Framework (4)**: Base components and styling system
- **Cultivation System (5)**: Cultivation data and progression
- **Scripture System (6)**: Scripture collection and study mechanics
- **Combat System (7)**: Combat mechanics and statistics
- **Sect System (8)**: Sect membership and interactions
- **Quest System (9)**: Quest management and progression

### File Dependencies
- `/src/ui/` - UI component library
- `/src/systems/` - All game system implementations
- `/src/data/` - Game data and configuration
- `/src/managers/` - System managers and controllers

## Effort Estimate

**Size: L (3-4 days)**

### Breakdown
- CultivationView: 0.5 days
- ScriptureView: 0.5 days
- CombatView: 0.5 days
- SectView: 0.5 days
- QuestView: 0.5 days
- Navigation & Polish: 1.5 days

### Risk Factors
- Complex data binding between views and systems
- Performance optimization for real-time updates
- Ensuring consistent UX across all screens
- Integration testing with all game systems

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All five main game views are fully implemented
- [ ] Views display accurate real-time game data
- [ ] Navigation between views is smooth and intuitive
- [ ] All interactive elements function correctly
- [ ] Views are responsive and performant
- [ ] Visual design is consistent with game theme
- [ ] All view transitions work without errors
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all view interactions
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance issues detected
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
