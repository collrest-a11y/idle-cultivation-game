# Sect System & Social Features

## Description

Develop a comprehensive sect (guild) system that enables players to form communities, collaborate on cultivation activities, and participate in inter-sect competitions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sect creation with customizable names, descriptions, and emblems
- [ ] Member management system with hierarchical roles and permissions
- [ ] Sect treasury for shared resource pooling and management
- [ ] Collaborative cultivation activities and group meditation sessions
- [ ] Sect missions and objectives with collective rewards
- [ ] Inter-sect competitions and territory control mechanics
- [ ] Sect ranking system based on collective member achievements
- [ ] Member communication system (chat, announcements, messaging)
- [ ] Sect upgrades and facilities that benefit all members
- [ ] Member contribution tracking and recognition system
- [ ] Sect alliance and diplomacy features

## Technical Details

### Sect Management Architecture
- Hierarchical role system (Sect Master, Elders, Core Disciples, Outer Disciples)
