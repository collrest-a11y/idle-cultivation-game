# Core Game Engine & State Management

## Description

Establish the foundational architecture for the idle cultivation game by implementing a robust core engine with centralized state management, event system, and modular component architecture. This forms the critical foundation that all other game systems will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GameState singleton class managing all game data with immutable state updates
- [ ] Event system supporting pub/sub pattern for decoupled component communication
- [ ] Core game loop with configurable tick rates for different systems
- [ ] Module system for registering and managing game components
- [ ] Time management system for handling offline progression
- [ ] Basic error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] Performance monitoring hooks for optimization
- [ ] Development mode utilities for debugging

## Technical Details

### GameState Implementation
- Singleton pattern with lazy initialization
- Immutable state updates using structured cloning
- State validation and schema enforcement
- Change detection and dirty tracking
- Nested state path access utilities

### Event System
- Observer pattern with typed event definitions
- Event priority and ordering support
- Async event handling capabilities
- Event history for debugging
- Performance metrics for event processing

### Core Game Loop
- RequestAnimationFrame-based main loop
- Separate tick rates for UI (60fps) and game logic (1-10fps)
- Pause/resume functionality
- Time scaling for testing and balance
- Graceful handling of tab visibility changes

### Module Architecture
- Base module interface with lifecycle hooks
- Dependency injection for module communication
- Hot module replacement for development
- Module loading order management
- Configuration validation per module

## Dependencies

None - This is the foundational component that all other systems depend on.

## Effort Estimate

**Size: L (3-4 days)**

- Day 1: GameState singleton and basic architecture
- Day 2: Event system and core game loop
- Day 3: Module system and time management
- Day 4: Testing, optimization, and documentation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All core classes implemented with full TypeScript types
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for state updates and events
- [ ] Documentation with code examples for all public APIs
- [ ] Integration tests demonstrating module loading and communication
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully with appropriate logging
- [ ] Development utilities functional and documented
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
