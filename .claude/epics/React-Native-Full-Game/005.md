# Task: Database Schema & Services

## Description
Design and implement PostgreSQL database schema with Redis caching layer, data access objects, and database migration system. This includes user management, cultivation progress, game state persistence, and optimized queries for real-time operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL 16 database schema designed and implemented
- [ ] Redis 7 caching layer for sessions and frequently accessed data
- [ ] Database migration system with version control
- [ ] Data access layer with typed ORM integration
- [ ] Optimized queries for cultivation progress and real-time updates
- [ ] Database indexing strategy for performance
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures implemented
- [ ] Connection pooling and performance optimization

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, Redis for caching and sessions
- Key considerations: Data normalization, indexing strategy, read replica setup for scaling
- Code locations/files affected: backend/src/database/, backend/prisma/, backend/src/services/
- Libraries: prisma, redis, pg (PostgreSQL driver), connection pooling
- Schema design: Users, cultivation progress, items, combat records, sect management

## Dependencies
- [ ] PostgreSQL 16 database server setup
- [ ] Redis 7 cluster configuration
- [ ] Database hosting environment prepared

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside other backend services)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Database schema implemented with all required tables
- [ ] Redis caching working for sessions and game data
- [ ] Migration system functional with rollback capability
- [ ] Data access layer complete with proper typing
- [ ] Database performance optimized with proper indexing
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested and documented
