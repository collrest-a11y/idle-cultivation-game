# Task: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing suite using Playwright MCP for end-to-end validation, covering all features, performance benchmarks, and mobile-specific scenarios. This includes unit tests, integration tests, performance testing, and automated quality assurance validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Playwright MCP test suite covering all major user flows
- [ ] Unit tests for all critical business logic components
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- [ ] Performance testing for mobile app and backend services
- [ ] Cross-platform testing on iOS and Android devices
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent user scenarios (1000+ users)
- [ ] Security testing for authentication and data protection
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Playwright MCP for E2E tests, Jest for unit tests, k6 for load testing
- Key considerations: Mobile device testing, real-time feature validation, performance benchmarks
- Code locations/files affected: tests/, e2e/, performance/, __tests__/
- Testing tools: Playwright MCP, Jest, React Native Testing Library, k6 for load testing
- Coverage: Authentication flows, cultivation mechanics, combat system, gacha operations, sect features

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Mobile App Foundation) completed
- [ ] Task 002 (Authentication Integration) completed
- [ ] Task 003 (Real-Time Cultivation System) completed
- [ ] Task 006 (Combat & Multiplayer Features) completed
- [ ] Task 007 (Scripture Gacha System) completed
- [ ] Task 008 (Sect Management System) completed
- [ ] Playwright MCP environment configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 44-56 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed features to test)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] 90%+ code coverage achieved across all components
- [ ] All major user flows validated with Playwright MCP
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (3s cold start, 60fps, 200ms API)
- [ ] Load testing successful with 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified on real devices
- [ ] All tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline and passing
