# Epic: React-Native-Full-Game

## Overview
Build a production-ready cross-platform idle cultivation game using React Native with a comprehensive Node.js backend. The system will feature real-time multiplayer capabilities, persistent cloud saves, live events, and enterprise-grade testing with Playwright MCP validation. This epic leverages the existing web-based game foundation while extending it for mobile platforms with professional networking and deployment infrastructure.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Mobile-First Design**: React Native 0.73+ with New Architecture (TurboModules + Fabric) for optimal performance
- **TypeScript Throughout**: Strict TypeScript 5.3+ for both frontend and backend with comprehensive type safety
- **Microservices Backend**: Node.js 20 LTS with Express.js, PostgreSQL 16, and Redis 7 for scalable architecture
- **Real-Time Communications**: Socket.IO for instant multiplayer interactions and live cultivation updates
- **Production Infrastructure**: Kubernetes deployment with Docker containerization and comprehensive monitoring
- **Security-First**: JWT with refresh tokens, rate limiting, input validation, and secure token storage
- **Testing Strategy**: Playwright MCP for end-to-end validation, covering real-time features and performance

## Technical Approach
### Frontend Components
- **Authentication System**: Secure login/registration with biometric support and token management
- **Real-Time Cultivation UI**: Live progress indicators with WebSocket integration for instant updates
- **Combat Interface**: Turn-based combat with smooth animations and real-time opponent matching
- **Scripture Collection**: Gacha system with animated pulls and collection management
- **Sect Management**: Guild-like features with collaborative cultivation and events
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for efficient data synchronization

### Backend Services
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens and secure session management
- **Cultivation Engine**: Real-time and offline progress calculation with anti-cheat validation
- **Combat System**: Turn-based battle logic with matchmaking and real-time events
- **Gacha Service**: Server-validated scripture pulls with pity counter and rate protection
- **Sect Management**: Multi-player guild features with collaborative bonuses and events
- **Analytics Service**: Player behavior tracking and game balance monitoring

### Infrastructure
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes with auto-scaling and health monitoring
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with read replicas and Redis for caching and sessions
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX reverse proxy with SSL termination and rate limiting
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for comprehensive observability
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment validation

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core mobile app structure with authentication and basic cultivation
- **Phase 2**: Real-time features with WebSocket integration and offline calculation
- **Phase 3**: Multiplayer systems including combat and sect management
- **Phase 4**: Production deployment with monitoring and performance optimization
- **Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing at each phase with Playwright MCP validation
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize for mobile constraints while maintaining 60fps animations

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Mobile App Foundation**: React Native setup with TypeScript, navigation, and basic UI components
- [ ] **Authentication Integration**: Secure login system with biometric support and token management
- [ ] **Real-Time Cultivation System**: WebSocket-based live cultivation with offline progress calculation
- [ ] **Backend API Development**: Node.js services for authentication, cultivation, and game logic
- [ ] **Database Schema & Services**: PostgreSQL setup with Redis caching and data access layers
- [ ] **Combat & Multiplayer Features**: Turn-based combat system with real-time opponent matching
- [ ] **Scripture Gacha System**: Server-validated pulls with collection management and animations
- [ ] **Sect Management System**: Guild features with collaborative cultivation and events
- [ ] **Production Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes deployment with monitoring and CI/CD
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: Playwright MCP tests covering all features and performance validation

## Dependencies
