# Task: Real-Time Cultivation System

## Description
Implement WebSocket-based real-time cultivation system with live progress indicators, offline progress calculation, and synchronization between client and server. This includes cultivation UI components, progress animations, and idle game mechanics for continuous progression.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket connection management with auto-reconnection
- [ ] Real-time cultivation progress updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Offline progress calculation when app is backgrounded
- [ ] Cultivation UI with animated progress bars and visual feedback
- [ ] Multiple cultivation stages with different progression rates
- [ ] Breakthrough system with requirements and animations
- [ ] Energy/qi management with regeneration mechanics
- [ ] Background task handling for cultivation when app is minimized

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Socket.IO client for WebSocket, React Native background tasks for offline calculation
- Key considerations: Battery optimization, precise timing for idle calculations, network reliability
- Code locations/files affected: src/cultivation/, src/components/cultivation/, src/services/websocket/
- Libraries: socket.io-client, @react-native-async-storage/async-storage, react-native-background-job
- Real-time updates: Cultivation progress, energy regeneration, breakthrough notifications

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Mobile App Foundation) completed
- [ ] Task 002 (Authentication Integration) completed
- [ ] WebSocket server implementation available
- [ ] Background processing permissions configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 32-40 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside backend development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Real-time cultivation system fully functional
- [ ] WebSocket connection stable with proper error handling
- [ ] Offline progress calculation accurate and tested
- [ ] Cultivation UI smooth with 60fps animations
- [ ] Background processing working on both platforms
- [ ] All cultivation mechanics implemented and balanced
