# Task: Production Infrastructure

## Description
Set up production-ready infrastructure with Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, monitoring stack, and CI/CD pipeline. This includes load balancing, auto-scaling, health monitoring, and deployment automation for zero-downtime updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Docker containers for all backend services
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster configuration with auto-scaling
- [ ] NGINX reverse proxy with SSL termination and rate limiting
- [ ] Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK) deployed
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Load balancing and health check configuration
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Production security hardening and compliance

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts for service deployment, GitHub Actions workflows
- Key considerations: Zero-downtime deployments, scalability, security, monitoring coverage
- Code locations/files affected: k8s/, docker/, .github/workflows/, monitoring/
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes cluster, Docker registry, monitoring stack, CI/CD pipelines
- Deployment: Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 (Backend API Development) completed
- [ ] Task 005 (Database Schema & Services) completed
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster provisioned
- [ ] Docker registry access configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 40-52 hours
- Parallel: true (can set up infrastructure while development continues)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Production infrastructure fully deployed and operational
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working with automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active with proper coverage
- [ ] Load balancing and auto-scaling verified under load
- [ ] Security measures implemented and audited
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures tested and documented
