  - Multi-stage animation sequences (preparation → breakthrough → success/failure)
  - Physics-based particle movement
  - Shockwave effects for dramatic moments
  - 60fps optimization with useNativeDriver

## Technical Achievements

### Performance Optimizations
- **60fps Animation Targeting**: All animations use `useNativeDriver` where possible
- **Particle System Optimization**: Configurable particle counts based on device capabilities
- **Responsive Performance**: Different FPS targets for different device classes
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of animation timers and listeners

### Animation Features
- **Smooth Progress Transitions**: Eased progress bar animations with configurable durations
- **Visual Feedback**: Pulse effects, glow effects, and particle systems
- **Breakthrough Spectacle**: Dramatic breakthrough animations with multiple stages
- **Energy Flow Visualization**: Particle-based qi/energy flow representations

### Responsive Design
- **Multi-Device Support**: Optimized layouts for phones and tablets
- **Orientation Handling**: Landscape and portrait layout adaptations
- **Performance Scaling**: Reduced particle counts and effects on lower-end devices
- **Accessibility**: Minimum touch targets and text scaling support

### Integration Points
- **Existing Types**: Built upon Stream B cultivation types and WebSocket interfaces
- **Theme System**: Consistent Wuxia/Xianxia theming throughout
- **State Management**: Ready for integration with cultivation store from Stream B
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket event integration prepared
