# Task: Authentication Integration

## Description
Implement secure authentication system with biometric support, token management, and secure storage. This includes login/registration screens, JWT token handling with refresh tokens, and integration with device biometric authentication capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login and registration screens with form validation
- [ ] JWT token-based authentication with refresh token mechanism
- [ ] Biometric authentication support (fingerprint/face ID)
- [ ] Secure token storage using Keychain (iOS) and Keystore (Android)
- [ ] Auto-login functionality with token validation
- [ ] Logout functionality with secure token cleanup
- [ ] Loading states and error handling for all auth flows

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Use React Native Keychain for secure storage, react-native-biometrics for biometric auth
- Key considerations: Token expiry handling, network error resilience, secure storage best practices
- Code locations/files affected: src/auth/, src/components/auth/, src/store/auth/
- Libraries: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage, react-native-keychain, react-native-biometrics
- Authentication flow: Login → Token storage → Biometric setup → Auto-login on app restart

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Mobile App Foundation) completed
- [ ] Backend authentication API endpoints available
- [ ] Biometric permissions configured in app manifests

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-28 hours
- Parallel: false (requires app foundation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Authentication screens implemented and functional
- [ ] JWT token handling with refresh logic working
- [ ] Biometric authentication integrated and tested on real devices
- [ ] Secure token storage verified on both platforms
- [ ] All authentication flows tested with proper error handling
- [ ] Auto-login working correctly after app restart
