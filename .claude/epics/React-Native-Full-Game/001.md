# Task: Mobile App Foundation

## Description
Set up the React Native project foundation with TypeScript configuration, navigation infrastructure, and basic UI components. This includes project initialization with React Native 0.73+ using New Architecture (TurboModules + Fabric), essential dependencies, and core mobile app structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React Native 0.73+ project created with New Architecture enabled
- [ ] TypeScript 5.3+ configuration with strict mode enabled
- [ ] Navigation structure implemented using React Navigation 6
- [ ] Basic UI component library established with consistent theming
- [ ] Project builds successfully for both iOS and Android platforms
- [ ] Hot reload and development environment fully functional
- [ ] Linting and formatting rules configured (ESLint + Prettier)

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Initialize React Native CLI project with TypeScript template
- Key considerations: Enable New Architecture for performance benefits, configure Metro bundler
- Code locations/files affected: Root project structure, metro.config.js, tsconfig.json, package.json
- UI framework: Use React Native Elements or NativeBase for consistent component library
- Navigation: Stack navigator for main screens, tab navigator for primary sections

## Dependencies
- [ ] React Native development environment setup completed
- [ ] Android SDK and Xcode installed and configured
- [ ] Node.js 20 LTS installed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: false (foundation must be established first)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and project structure established
- [ ] Both iOS and Android builds working without errors
- [ ] Development environment fully functional with hot reload
- [ ] TypeScript compilation working without errors
- [ ] Basic navigation between placeholder screens working
- [ ] Code quality tools configured and passing
