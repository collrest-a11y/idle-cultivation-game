# Task: Backend API Development

## Description
Develop comprehensive Node.js backend services including authentication, cultivation engine, and core game logic APIs. This includes Express.js server setup, middleware configuration, rate limiting, input validation, and API endpoint implementation for all game features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Express.js server with TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Authentication endpoints with JWT and refresh token support
- [ ] Cultivation API endpoints for progress tracking and updates
- [ ] Rate limiting and request validation middleware
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Health check and monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Express.js with TypeScript, middleware for auth/validation/logging
- Key considerations: Security best practices, API versioning, scalability design
- Code locations/files affected: backend/src/routes/, backend/src/middleware/, backend/src/controllers/
- Libraries: express, express-rate-limit, joi/zod for validation, winston for logging
- API structure: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes and error responses

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js 20 LTS development environment
- [ ] Database schema design completed
- [ ] Authentication strategy finalized

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 36-48 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside mobile app)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All API endpoints implemented and functional
- [ ] Authentication and authorization working correctly
- [ ] Rate limiting and security measures active
- [ ] API documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive with proper logging
- [ ] All endpoints tested with proper validation
