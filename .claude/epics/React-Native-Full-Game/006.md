# Task: Combat & Multiplayer Features

## Description
Implement turn-based combat system with real-time opponent matching, battle animations, and multiplayer interaction features. This includes combat mechanics, matchmaking algorithms, battle result processing, and real-time battle state synchronization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Turn-based combat engine with skill and cultivation integration
- [ ] Real-time opponent matching based on cultivation level
- [ ] Battle UI with smooth animations and visual effects
- [ ] Combat result processing with rewards and experience
- [ ] Spectator mode for ongoing battles
- [ ] Battle history and statistics tracking
- [ ] Anti-cheat validation for combat actions
- [ ] Real-time battle state synchronization via WebSocket

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Socket.IO for real-time battle state, React Native Animated API for combat animations
- Key considerations: Battle balance, latency handling, cheat prevention, fair matchmaking
- Code locations/files affected: src/combat/, src/components/battle/, backend/src/combat/
- Libraries: react-native-reanimated, lottie-react-native for animations
- Combat flow: Matchmaking → Battle setup → Turn execution → Result processing

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 (Real-Time Cultivation System) completed
- [ ] Task 004 (Backend API Development) completed
- [ ] Task 005 (Database Schema & Services) completed
- [ ] WebSocket infrastructure available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 40-50 hours
- Parallel: true (can work with other feature teams)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Combat system fully functional with all mechanics
- [ ] Matchmaking working with fair opponent selection
- [ ] Battle animations smooth and engaging
- [ ] Real-time synchronization stable during battles
- [ ] Anti-cheat measures implemented and tested
- [ ] Battle statistics and history working correctly
