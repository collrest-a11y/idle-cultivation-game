## Next Actions Required

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Assign Phase 1 Issues** - Allocate developers to foundation issues
2. **Environment Setup** - Prepare React Native development environment
3. **Repository Setup** - Initialize React Native project structure
4. **Development Standards** - Establish coding standards and review process

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Complete Issue #26** - React Native project foundation
2. **Begin Issue #32** - UI component library development
3. **Backend Planning** - Prepare Phase 2 backend infrastructure requirements
4. **Testing Strategy** - Finalize testing approach and tool selection

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Complete Phase 1** - Mobile app foundation ready
2. **Start Phase 2** - Backend development and real-time systems
3. **Integration Planning** - Plan mobile-backend integration approach
4. **Performance Baselines** - Establish performance measurement baselines

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **React Native Complexity**: Mitigate with experienced RN developer assignment
- **Real-time Performance**: Early WebSocket testing and optimization
- **Cross-platform Issues**: Continuous testing on both iOS and Android
- **Backend Scaling**: Load testing throughout development

### Timeline Risks
- **Dependency Bottlenecks**: Parallel development where possible
- **Resource Availability**: Cross-training and documentation
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to defined acceptance criteria
- **Integration Challenges**: Early integration testing and validation

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] React Native app builds successfully on iOS and Android
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled with no compilation errors
- [ ] Navigation system functional with basic routing
- [ ] UI component library with 8+ core components
- [ ] Redux store configured with RTK Query integration
- [ ] Development environment fully operational

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Code coverage > 80% for all new components
- [ ] Performance: App cold start < 3 seconds
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Accessibility compliance for all UI components
- [ ] Cross-platform UI consistency validated

## Development Team Coordination

### Recommended Team Structure
- **1 Senior React Native Developer** - Lead Phase 1 development
- **1 Backend Developer** - Prepare Phase 2 backend systems
- **1 DevOps Engineer** - Infrastructure and deployment preparation
- **1 QA Engineer** - Testing strategy and automation setup

### Communication Plan
- **Daily Standups** - Progress updates and blocker resolution
- **Weekly Reviews** - Phase progress and milestone tracking
- **Bi-weekly Planning** - Sprint planning and priority adjustment
- **Monthly Retrospectives** - Process improvement and lessons learned
