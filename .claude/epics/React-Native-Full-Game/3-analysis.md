# Issue #3 Analysis: Real-Time Cultivation System

## Work Breakdown

This real-time cultivation system can be broken into 3 parallel streams:

### Stream A: WebSocket Infrastructure & Connection Management (Agent-1)
**Files:** `mobile/src/services/websocket/`, `mobile/src/services/connection/`
**Work:**
- Create WebSocketService.js with Socket.IO client integration
- Implement auto-reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Set up connection state management and error handling
- Create WebSocket event system for cultivation updates
- Implement network status monitoring and offline detection
- Add connection quality indicators and fallback mechanisms

**Estimated time:** 12-16 hours

### Stream B: Cultivation Core System & State Management (Agent-2)
**Files:** `mobile/src/cultivation/`, `mobile/src/store/cultivation/`, `mobile/src/services/cultivation/`
**Work:**
- Create CultivationSystem.js with idle game mechanics
- Implement cultivation stages, breakthrough requirements, and progression logic
- Set up energy/qi management with regeneration timers
- Create offline progress calculation algorithms
- Implement cultivation state persistence and recovery
- Add background task handling for iOS/Android

**Estimated time:** 14-18 hours

### Stream C: Cultivation UI Components & Animations (Agent-3)
**Files:** `mobile/src/components/cultivation/`, `mobile/src/screens/cultivation/`
**Work:**
- Create CultivationScreen.tsx with main cultivation interface
- Implement animated progress bars with smooth 60fps animations
- Create breakthrough animation system and visual effects
- Build energy/qi indicator components with real-time updates
- Implement cultivation stage visualization and feedback
- Add responsive design for different screen sizes

**Estimated time:** 10-14 hours

## Dependencies Between Streams

- Stream B (core system) should start first to define data structures and business logic
- Stream A can begin in parallel, focusing on connection infrastructure
- Stream C depends on Stream B for cultivation state definitions and Stream A for real-time update integration
- Final integration requires all streams to coordinate on event handling and state synchronization

## Coordination Points

### Data Flow Architecture
- CultivationSystem (Stream B) defines state structure for cultivation progress, energy, and stages
- WebSocketService (Stream A) handles real-time sync of cultivation state changes
- UI Components (Stream C) consume state from CultivationSystem and WebSocket events

### Event System Integration
- WebSocket events for: `cultivation:progress`, `cultivation:breakthrough`, `energy:regenerated`
- Cultivation system events for: `stage:completed`, `breakthrough:available`, `offline:calculated`
- UI events for: `cultivation:start`, `cultivation:pause`, `breakthrough:triggered`

### Background Processing Coordination
- Stream A handles WebSocket connection management during app backgrounding
- Stream B implements offline calculation when app resumes
- Stream C manages UI state transitions between foreground/background modes

## Testing Strategy

### Stream A Testing
- WebSocket connection reliability tests
- Auto-reconnection scenario testing
- Network interruption handling tests
- Connection state management unit tests

### Stream B Testing
- Cultivation progression algorithm tests
- Offline calculation accuracy tests
- Background task functionality tests
- State persistence and recovery tests
- Energy regeneration timing tests

### Stream C Testing
- Animation performance tests (60fps validation)
- UI component integration tests
- Real-time update rendering tests
- Responsive design tests across device sizes

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end cultivation flow tests
- Real-time synchronization tests
- Background/foreground transition tests
- Multi-device state synchronization tests

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Maintain 60fps animations during cultivation progress updates
- Efficient battery usage for background processing
- Optimized WebSocket message handling to prevent UI blocking
- Smooth transitions between online/offline modes

### Platform-Specific Implementations
- iOS: Background App Refresh and Background Processing entitlements
- Android: Foreground service for cultivation calculations
- Cross-platform: React Native Background Job for offline calculations

### Security & Data Integrity
- Secure WebSocket connection with authentication tokens
- Cultivation progress validation on both client and server
- Prevention of client-side manipulation of progression rates
- Encrypted local storage for cultivation state

## Success Criteria

- Real-time cultivation progression with sub-second update latency
- Seamless offline/online transitions with accurate progress calculation
- Smooth 60fps animations throughout the cultivation interface
- Stable WebSocket connection with automatic recovery from network issues
- Background cultivation processing working on both iOS and Android
- All cultivation mechanics balanced and thoroughly tested

## Libraries and Dependencies

### Required Packages
- `socket.io-client`: WebSocket communication
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: Local state persistence
- `react-native-background-job`: Background processing
- `@react-native-community/netinfo`: Network status monitoring
- `react-native-reanimated`: High-performance animations

### Platform Permissions
- iOS: Background App Refresh, Background Processing
- Android: WAKE_LOCK, RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED, FOREGROUND_SERVICE

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- Authentication system (Issue #2): Token-based WebSocket authentication
- Mobile foundation (Issue #1): Navigation, UI components, and app structure
- Backend services: WebSocket server endpoints and cultivation APIs

### Future Dependencies
- Will provide cultivation state for character progression systems
- Foundation for real-time multiplayer features
- Base system for idle game mechanics in other areas
