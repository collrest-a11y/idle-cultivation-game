# Task: Critical Error Resolution & Code Hardening

## Description
Fix all existing critical errors in the game and implement zero-tolerance error handling throughout the codebase. This includes resolving ViewIntegration failures, notification system errors, and any undefined behavior patterns. Establish production-ready error handling as the foundation for all subsequent testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zero JavaScript console errors on fresh game load across all supported browsers
- [ ] ViewIntegration system works 100% reliably without failures
- [ ] Notification system handles all edge cases without undefined errors
- [ ] All undefined behavior patterns identified and resolved
- [ ] Enhanced ErrorManager captures all runtime issues with detailed logging
- [ ] Game loads consistently without blank screens in all browsers
- [ ] Character creation completes successfully in 100% of test cases
- [ ] All view transitions work without errors
- [ ] Production-ready error boundaries implemented for all components

## Technical Details
- **Fix ViewIntegration errors**: Resolve initialization failures and ensure reliable navigation
- **Notification system hardening**: Add null checks and default values for all notification properties
- **ErrorManager enhancement**: Extend existing error handling to capture all runtime issues
- **Code quality review**: Scan entire codebase for potential undefined behavior
- **Error boundary implementation**: Wrap all React-like components with comprehensive error handling
- **Browser compatibility fixes**: Ensure consistent behavior across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

**Key Files Affected:**
- `js/views/ViewIntegration.js`
- `js/views/MainMenuView.js`
- `js/core/ErrorManager.js`
- `js/main.js`
- All view components in `js/views/`

## Dependencies
- [ ] No external dependencies (foundational task)
- [ ] Existing game architecture must remain functional
- [ ] Current save data compatibility must be maintained

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: false (must complete before other testing tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with zero tolerance for errors
- [ ] Manual testing confirms zero console errors in all browsers
- [ ] All existing functionality works without regressions
- [ ] Error handling enhanced without breaking existing behavior
- [ ] Code reviewed for production readiness
- [ ] Basic smoke tests pass in all supported browsers
