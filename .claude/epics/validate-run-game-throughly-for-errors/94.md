# Task: Extended Session Testing System

## Description
Implement automated 24-48 hour testing system that validates game stability, memory usage, and performance during extended idle sessions. This system must monitor for memory leaks, performance degradation, and accuracy of calculations over long periods while ensuring the game remains fully functional.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 24-48 hour automated testing sessions run successfully
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring shows zero growth over extended periods
- [ ] Performance metrics remain stable (no degradation over time)
- [ ] All calculations maintain accuracy over extended time periods
- [ ] Zero memory leaks detected during long sessions
- [ ] Frame rate remains consistent (60fps) throughout sessions
- [ ] Auto-save functionality works perfectly at all intervals
- [ ] Game state remains 100% accurate and consistent
- [ ] Browser tabs remain responsive after 48+ hours
- [ ] CPU usage stays under 5% during idle periods

## Technical Details
- **Extended Session Automation**: Scripts to run game continuously for 48+ hours
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking and leak detection
- **Performance Profiling**: Continuous performance metrics collection
- **Calculation Validation**: Verify mathematical accuracy over time
- **Resource Usage Tracking**: Monitor CPU, memory, and browser resource consumption
- **State Consistency Checking**: Validate game state integrity throughout sessions

**Key Files to Create:**
- `tests/extended/session-runner.js`
- `tests/extended/memory-monitor.js`
- `tests/extended/performance-tracker.js`
- `tests/extended/calculation-validator.js`
- `tests/extended/resource-monitor.js`
- `tests/extended/state-validator.js`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (stable foundation required)
- [ ] Task 002 completed (browser testing infrastructure)
- [ ] Enhanced PerformanceMonitor available
- [ ] Browser DevTools Protocol access configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside other validation tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Extended session testing system implemented and operational
- [ ] 48+ hour test sessions complete successfully without issues
- [ ] Memory usage verified stable with zero growth tolerance
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met throughout entire session duration
- [ ] Mathematical calculations verified accurate over extended periods
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system functional
