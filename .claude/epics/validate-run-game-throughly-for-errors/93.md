# Task: Live Browser Testing Infrastructure

## Description
Set up comprehensive Puppeteer-based testing infrastructure that validates every feature by actually running the game in real browsers. Implement automated cross-browser testing framework with support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Every test must verify expected outputs by executing actual game code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Puppeteer testing framework fully configured and operational
- [ ] Cross-browser testing support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Automated test suite that opens and runs actual game in browsers
- [ ] Test orchestration engine for coordinating multiple test scenarios
- [ ] Real-time test execution monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Browser automation scripts for all user interaction patterns
- [ ] Performance monitoring integration during test execution
- [ ] Test result validation with expected output verification
- [ ] Comprehensive test logging and error reporting
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing

## Technical Details
- **Puppeteer Setup**: Configure Puppeteer with multiple browser engines
- **Test Framework**: Implement Jest + Puppeteer testing architecture
- **Browser Controller**: Manage multiple browser instances for parallel testing
- **Test Orchestration**: Coordinate test execution across different browsers and scenarios
- **Performance Integration**: Connect with existing PerformanceMonitor for metrics
- **Error Capture**: Integrate with enhanced ErrorManager for comprehensive logging

**Key Files to Create:**
- `tests/infrastructure/browser-testing.js`
- `tests/infrastructure/puppeteer-config.js`
- `tests/infrastructure/test-orchestrator.js`
- `tests/infrastructure/cross-browser-runner.js`
- `tests/utils/test-helpers.js`
- `package.json` (updated dependencies)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (critical errors resolved)
- [ ] Puppeteer npm package installed
- [ ] Jest testing framework configured
- [ ] Browser binaries available for testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-28 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other infrastructure tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Testing infrastructure implemented and functional
- [ ] All supported browsers can be automated for testing
- [ ] Test suite successfully runs game in browsers and validates outputs
- [ ] Performance monitoring integrated into test execution
- [ ] Error logging captures all issues during testing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured for automated test execution
