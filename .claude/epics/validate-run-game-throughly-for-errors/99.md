# Task: Error Monitoring & Alerting System

## Description
Implement comprehensive error monitoring and real-time alerting system that captures all runtime issues, provides detailed logging, and enables immediate detection and resolution of any problems. Enhance existing ErrorManager with production-ready monitoring capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time error detection and alerting system operational
- [ ] All JavaScript errors captured with detailed stack traces
- [ ] Module initialization failures detected and reported
- [ ] View navigation errors monitored and logged
- [ ] Network failure detection and graceful degradation
- [ ] Mean time to error detection under 1 minute
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging with context information
- [ ] Error classification and severity assessment
- [ ] Automatic error recovery mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Error reporting dashboard with analytics

## Technical Details
- **Enhanced Error Capture**: Extend ErrorManager to capture all error types
- **Real-time Alerting**: Immediate notification system for critical errors
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error context and stack trace capture
- **Error Classification**: Categorize errors by type, severity, and impact
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery for transient issues
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time error analytics and reporting

**Key Files to Create:**
- `js/monitoring/enhanced-error-manager.js`
- `js/monitoring/real-time-alerting.js`
- `js/monitoring/error-logger.js`
- `js/monitoring/error-classifier.js`
- `js/monitoring/recovery-mechanisms.js`
- `js/monitoring/error-dashboard.js`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (existing ErrorManager enhanced)
- [ ] Real-time communication infrastructure (if needed)
- [ ] Error logging and storage mechanisms
- [ ] Alerting notification system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-24 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other monitoring tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Error monitoring system implemented and operational
- [ ] Real-time alerting responds to all error types within 1 minute
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging captures all necessary context
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms handle transient issues automatically
- [ ] Error analytics dashboard provides actionable insights
- [ ] System meets zero tolerance requirements for error handling
