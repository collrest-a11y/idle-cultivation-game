# Task: Cross-Browser Compatibility Validation

## Description
Ensure 100% compatibility and identical behavior across all supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) through comprehensive automated testing. Validate that every game feature works identically across browsers with zero tolerance for compatibility issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 100% identical behavior across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- [ ] Game initialization works consistently in all browsers
- [ ] All view transitions function identically across browsers
- [ ] JavaScript API compatibility verified for all browser engines
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met in all browser environments
- [ ] Mobile browser compatibility validated (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Progressive enhancement tested for older browser versions
- [ ] Cross-browser automated test suite passes 100% consistently
- [ ] Browser-specific quirks identified and resolved
- [ ] Responsive design validated across different screen sizes

## Technical Details
- **Browser Matrix Testing**: Automated testing across all supported browsers
- **API Compatibility**: Verify JavaScript API usage works across browser engines
- **Performance Comparison**: Ensure consistent performance across browsers
- **Mobile Testing**: Validate mobile browser compatibility and responsiveness
- **Feature Detection**: Implement progressive enhancement for older browsers
- **Quirks Resolution**: Identify and fix browser-specific issues

**Key Files to Create:**
- `tests/cross-browser/browser-matrix.test.js`
- `tests/cross-browser/api-compatibility.test.js`
- `tests/cross-browser/performance-comparison.test.js`
- `tests/cross-browser/mobile-testing.test.js`
- `tests/cross-browser/quirks-testing.test.js`
- `tests/cross-browser/responsive-validation.test.js`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (stable game foundation)
- [ ] Task 002 completed (browser testing infrastructure)
- [ ] Multiple browser binaries available for testing
- [ ] Mobile device emulation capabilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other validation tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Cross-browser testing system implemented and operational
- [ ] 100% compatibility validated across all supported browsers
- [ ] Mobile browser compatibility verified and optimized
- [ ] Browser-specific quirks identified and resolved
- [ ] Automated test suite passes consistently in all browser environments
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met across all browser platforms
