# Task: Mathematical Accuracy Validation

## Description
Verify all game calculations produce mathematically correct results across all systems including cultivation, combat, gacha, and sect mechanics. Implement comprehensive testing with statistical validation for RNG systems and precision testing for large number calculations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All cultivation system calculations verified for mathematical accuracy
- [ ] Combat damage calculations produce expected results
- [ ] Gacha probability distributions validated over 100k+ iterations
- [ ] Sect system calculations verified for correctness
- [ ] Large number precision maintained without floating point errors
- [ ] RNG systems tested for proper statistical distribution
- [ ] Offline calculation accuracy verified for extended periods
- [ ] All mathematical formulas documented and validated
- [ ] Edge cases handled correctly (overflow, underflow, precision loss)
- [ ] Cross-system calculation consistency verified

## Technical Details
- **Cultivation Math**: Validate experience, breakthrough, and progression calculations
- **Combat System**: Verify damage, defense, and stat calculations
- **Gacha Statistics**: Statistical validation of pull rates and probability distributions
- **Sect Calculations**: Validate contribution, buff, and resource calculations
- **Precision Testing**: Test large number handling and floating point accuracy
- **RNG Validation**: Statistical analysis of random number generation

**Key Files to Create:**
