# Task: Performance Monitoring & Optimization

## Description
Implement comprehensive real-time performance tracking and optimization system that ensures all performance benchmarks are met consistently. Monitor frame rates, memory usage, CPU consumption, and optimize for production-ready performance standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Game initialization consistently under 2 seconds
- [ ] View transitions consistently under 200ms
- [ ] Frame rate maintains consistent 60fps during animations
- [ ] CPU usage stays under 5% during idle periods
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable with zero growth over time
- [ ] Save operations complete under 50ms consistently
- [ ] Garbage collection impact under 1ms pauses
- [ ] Real-time performance monitoring dashboard functional
- [ ] Performance regression detection and alerting implemented
- [ ] Optimization recommendations system operational

## Technical Details
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish and validate all performance requirements
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous performance metrics collection and display
- **Optimization Implementation**: Optimize code to meet strict performance standards
- **Regression Detection**: Automated detection of performance degradation
- **Memory Profiling**: Track memory usage patterns and identify leaks
- **CPU Monitoring**: Monitor and optimize CPU usage during all game operations

**Key Files to Create:**
- `tests/performance/benchmark-suite.test.js`
- `tests/performance/real-time-monitor.js`
- `tests/performance/optimization-analyzer.js`
- `tests/performance/regression-detector.js`
- `tests/performance/memory-profiler.js`
- `tests/performance/cpu-monitor.js`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (stable performance baseline)
- [ ] Task 002 completed (testing infrastructure)
- [ ] Enhanced PerformanceMonitor available
- [ ] Browser DevTools Protocol integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-28 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other monitoring tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance monitoring system implemented and operational
- [ ] All performance benchmarks consistently met across all scenarios
- [ ] Real-time performance dashboard provides comprehensive metrics
- [ ] Performance optimization implemented where needed
- [ ] Regression detection system alerts to any performance degradation
- [ ] Memory and CPU usage optimized to meet strict requirements
