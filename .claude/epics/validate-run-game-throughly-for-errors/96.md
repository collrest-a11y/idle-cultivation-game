# Task: Data Integrity & Save/Load Testing

## Description
Implement comprehensive save/load data validation and corruption prevention system. Test thousands of save/load operations to ensure zero data loss, validate save file format integrity, and implement robust corruption detection and recovery mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Save/load operations tested under high stress (thousands of operations)
- [ ] Zero data loss incidents across all testing scenarios
- [ ] Save file format validation prevents corruption
- [ ] Corrupt save file detection and recovery mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Race condition prevention in save operations
- [ ] Data migration testing between different save versions
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing save files
- [ ] Save operation performance under 50ms consistently
- [ ] Comprehensive save data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Recovery procedures for all data corruption scenarios

## Technical Details
- **Stress Testing**: Execute thousands of save/load operations in rapid succession
- **Corruption Simulation**: Test various corruption scenarios and recovery
- **Format Validation**: Validate save file structure and data integrity
- **Race Condition Testing**: Prevent simultaneous save operations from causing corruption
- **Migration Testing**: Verify save compatibility across different game versions
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure save operations meet strict timing requirements

**Key Files to Create:**
- `tests/save-load/stress-testing.test.js`
- `tests/save-load/corruption-testing.test.js`
- `tests/save-load/format-validation.test.js`
- `tests/save-load/migration-testing.test.js`
- `tests/save-load/performance-testing.test.js`
- `tests/save-load/data-integrity-utils.js`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (stable SaveManager required)
- [ ] Enhanced SaveManager with integrity checking
- [ ] Access to save file format specifications
- [ ] Test data generation utilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-24 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other validation tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Data integrity testing system implemented and operational
- [ ] Thousands of save/load operations completed without data loss
- [ ] Corruption detection and recovery mechanisms validated
- [ ] Save operation performance benchmarks met consistently
- [ ] Migration testing completed for save file compatibility
- [ ] Comprehensive validation prevents all data corruption scenarios
