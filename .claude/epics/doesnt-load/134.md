# Task: Module Dependency Graph

## Description
Create and implement a dependency graph system that ensures modules load in the correct order based on their dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DependencyGraph.js created
- [ ] All module dependencies mapped
- [ ] Topological sort implemented
- [ ] Circular dependency detection
- [ ] Loading order optimized

## Technical Details
- Create js/core/DependencyGraph.js
- Parse all module imports/requires
- Build directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- Implement Kahn's algorithm for topological sort
- Detect and report circular dependencies

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 must be complete
- [ ] Access to all game modules

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] DependencyGraph.js implemented
- [ ] All modules mapped correctly
- [ ] Loading order validated
- [ ] Tests for edge cases passing
- [ ] Performance optimized
