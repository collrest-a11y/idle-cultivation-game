# Epic: doesnt-load

## Overview
Implement a bulletproof loading system for the idle cultivation game that ensures 100% reliable game initialization through immediate bug fixes, robust error recovery, and comprehensive Playwright validation. This leverages our existing error collector system to create a continuous improvement pipeline.

## Architecture Decisions

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Reuse Existing Systems**: Leverage the already-built error collector instead of creating new monitoring
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Fix critical errors first, then layer on advanced recovery
- **Validation-First**: Every change validated with Playwright before considering it complete
- **Minimal New Code**: Fix existing issues rather than rewriting entire systems

### Technology Choices
- **Testing**: Playwright MCP for cross-browser validation
- **Error Tracking**: Existing claude-error-collector system
- **Module Loading**: Enhanced version of existing ModuleManager
- **Recovery**: New ErrorRecovery module integrated with existing ErrorManager

### Design Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker**: For module loading with automatic retry
- **Observer Pattern**: Error events propagated through existing EventManager
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different recovery strategies based on error type
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplified loading API over complex module orchestration

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **LoadingSystem.js**: Orchestrates entire loading sequence with validation
- **ModuleValidator.js**: Runtime validation of each module before proceeding
- **ErrorRecovery.js**: Automatic recovery strategies for common failures
- **Enhanced LoadingProgress.js**: Real-time feedback with error context

### Module Dependencies
- Build dependency graph from existing module imports
- Validate loading order matches dependencies
- Implement topological sort for optimal loading sequence

### Error Integration
- Connect existing error collector to main index.html
- Auto-generate GitHub issues for critical errors
- Real-time error dashboard using existing collector UI

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Immediate Fixes** - Fix all current JavaScript errors preventing load
2. **Validation Layer** - Add module validation and dependency checking
3. **Recovery System** - Implement automatic error recovery
4. **Playwright Tests** - Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Integration** - Connect error collector and monitoring

### Risk Mitigation
- Each fix immediately validated with test page
- Rollback capability for each change
- Progressive deployment with feature flags

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for each new module
- Integration tests for loading sequence
- End-to-end Playwright tests for full game load
- Performance benchmarks to prevent regression

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories (limited to 10 for efficiency):

- [ ] **Task 1: Fix Critical Errors** - Audit and fix all JavaScript initialization errors
- [ ] **Task 2: Module Validation** - Implement module loading validation system
- [ ] **Task 3: Dependency Graph** - Create and validate module dependency ordering
- [ ] **Task 4: Error Recovery** - Build automatic recovery for common failures
- [ ] **Task 5: Loading Orchestration** - Create LoadingSystem.js to coordinate everything
- [ ] **Task 6: Error Integration** - Connect error collector to production game
- [ ] **Task 7: Playwright Core Tests** - Write essential loading validation tests
- [ ] **Task 8: Cross-Browser Tests** - Validate on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] **Task 9: Performance Validation** - Ensure <3 second load time
- [ ] **Task 10: Production Deployment** - Final integration and monitoring setup

## Dependencies

### External Service Dependencies
- Playwright MCP for automated testing
- GitHub API for issue creation (optional enhancement)
- Browser DevTools for debugging

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing ErrorManager module
- Existing EventManager for error propagation
- Existing SaveManager for state preservation
- Already-built error collector system

### Prerequisite Work
- Error collector system (✅ Already complete)
- Basic game structure (✅ Exists)

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- Load time <3 seconds on 3G connection
- Zero blocking errors during initialization
- Memory usage <100MB during load
- CPU usage <50% peak

### Quality Gates
- 100% Playwright test suite passing
- Zero console errors in production
- All modules validate successfully
- Error recovery rate >95%

### Acceptance Criteria
- Game loads successfully 100% of the time (with recovery)
- Errors automatically captured and reported
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Save data preserved through recovery

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 8-10 hours of focused development
- **Parallel Execution**: Can reduce to 4-5 hours with parallel tasks

### Resource Requirements
- 1 developer (full implementation)
- Playwright MCP access for testing
- Test devices/browsers for validation

### Critical Path Items
1. Fix critical errors (blocks everything)
2. Module validation (blocks loading system)
3. Playwright tests (blocks deployment)

### Parallel Opportunities
- Tasks 1, 6, and 7 can start immediately in parallel
- Tasks 2-5 can be developed concurrently after Task 1
- Tasks 8-10 can run in parallel after core implementation
