# Task: Skills Balance and Polish Progression Tuning and UX Enhancements

## Description
Fine-tune skill balance, progression curves, and user experience based on testing results and gameplay feedback. Implement final polish including performance optimizations, UI enhancements, and production readiness preparations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skill power levels balanced across all tiers and categories
- [ ] Progression curves tuned for appropriate pacing and player engagement
- [ ] UI polish including animations, visual feedback, and accessibility improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations for skill calculations and UI rendering
- [ ] Documentation updated for skills system architecture and usage
- [ ] Production deployment preparation including feature flags and monitoring

## Technical Details
- Analyze skill usage data and player feedback to identify balance issues
- Adjust skill power levels, synergy effects, and evolution benefits for optimal balance
- Tune progression curves including skill point earning rates and evolution requirements
- Implement UI polish including smooth animations, better visual feedback, and accessibility features
- Optimize performance bottlenecks in skill calculations and synergy detection
- Create comprehensive documentation for system maintenance and future development
