# Task: Skills System Testing Comprehensive Test Suite

## Description
Develop comprehensive test suite covering all aspects of the skills system including unit tests, integration tests, performance validation, and balance testing. Ensure system reliability and performance under various gameplay scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests covering all skill system components with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for skill system interaction with existing systems
- [ ] Performance tests validating skill effect calculation benchmarks
- [ ] Balance tests ensuring proper progression curves and skill effectiveness
- [ ] Load testing for large skill collections and complex synergy calculations
- [ ] Automated test suite integrated with existing testing framework

## Technical Details
- Create comprehensive unit tests for SkillSystem, SkillManager, SynergyCalculator, and EvolutionManager
- Implement integration tests covering skill-gacha, skill-cultivation, and skill-combat interactions
- Build performance tests validating skill effect calculations meet < 1ms per skill benchmark
- Create balance validation tests ensuring skill progression curves and power scaling
- Implement load testing for scenarios with many active skills and complex synergies
- Set up automated testing pipeline integration with existing test infrastructure

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Core Skills System Foundation
- [ ] Task 002: Skill Gacha Integration
- [ ] Task 003: Skills UI
- [ ] Task 004: Dynamic Synergy System
- [ ] Task 005: Skill Evolution System
- [ ] Task 006: Cultivation Integration
- [ ] Existing testing framework and infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-24 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed features to test)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved for skills system
- [ ] All unit tests passing and properly structured
- [ ] Integration tests covering system interactions passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met and validated
- [ ] Balance tests confirming proper progression curves
- [ ] Automated test suite integrated and running
