# Task: Core Skills System Foundation Architecture

## Description
Implement the foundational architecture for the skills system including SkillSystem coordinator, SkillManager for core logic, and data structures. This forms the backbone that all other skill-related features will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SkillSystem class implemented with integration to existing ModuleManager
- [ ] SkillManager class with skill unlocking, leveling, and validation logic
- [ ] GameState extended with skills section including proper data structure
- [ ] skill-data.js file with initial skill definitions and structure
- [ ] Basic skill effect calculation framework
- [ ] Integration with existing EventManager for skill events

## Technical Details
- Create SkillSystem.js as main coordinator following existing system patterns
- Implement SkillManager.js with core skill logic and state management
- Extend GameState with skills object containing unlocked skills, active loadout, skill points, fragments, and mastery levels
- Create skill-data.js with JSON-based skill definitions including categories, effects, and requirements
- Implement basic skill effect calculation system that integrates with game loop
- Set up EventManager integration for skill acquisition and effect events

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing GameState structure for extension
- [ ] EventManager for skill events integration
- [ ] ModuleManager for proper dependency injection
- [ ] Game loop for effect calculation integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-40 hours
- Parallel: false (foundation for all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and follows existing architecture patterns
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with existing systems passing
- [ ] GameState properly extended with skill data structure
- [ ] EventManager integration working for skill events
- [ ] Code reviewed and meets project standards
