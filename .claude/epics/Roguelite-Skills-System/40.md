# Task: Skill Evolution System Advancement and Specialization

## Description
Implement skill evolution system allowing skills to advance into specialized versions with enhanced effects and new capabilities. The system should provide meaningful progression choices and build specialization opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] EvolutionManager class for handling skill advancement paths
- [ ] Evolution tree data structure with branching advancement options
- [ ] Evolution requirement validation system (mastery, resources, synergies)
- [ ] Evolution choice interface allowing players to select advancement paths
- [ ] Evolved skill effect calculation with enhanced capabilities
- [ ] Evolution history tracking and respec functionality

## Technical Details
- Create EvolutionManager.js with skill evolution logic and path validation
- Implement evolution-data.js with skill evolution trees and requirement definitions
- Build evolution requirement system checking mastery levels, resources, and synergy prerequisites
- Create evolution choice UI allowing players to preview and select evolution paths
- Implement evolved skill effects that build upon base skill functionality
- Add evolution history tracking and optional respec system for build experimentation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Core Skills System Foundation
- [ ] Task 004: Dynamic Synergy System for synergy-based evolution requirements
- [ ] Existing resource management systems for evolution costs
- [ ] UI components for evolution path selection

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other features)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] EvolutionManager implemented with complete evolution logic
- [ ] Evolution trees properly defined and balanced
- [ ] Evolution requirement validation working correctly
- [ ] Evolution UI implemented and user-friendly
- [ ] Evolved skill effects properly calculated and applied
- [ ] Evolution system integrated with existing progression mechanics
