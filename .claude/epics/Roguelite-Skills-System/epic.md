# Epic: Roguelite-Skills-System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive skills system that integrates seamlessly with the existing game architecture, providing dynamic progression through cultivation-gated unlocks, gacha acquisition, and build diversity through synergies and evolution. The system leverages existing modular architecture and extends the current gacha and progression systems to create unique player journeys with meaningful choices at every step.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core System Design
- **Modular Architecture**: Follow existing pattern with `SkillSystem.js` as main coordinator and separate managers for different aspects
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Use existing EventManager for skill acquisition, evolution, and synergy discovery events
- **State Management**: Extend GameState with skills section, leveraging existing validation and save systems
- **Data-Driven Configuration**: Use existing data file pattern with `skill-data.js` for skill definitions

### Technology Choices
- **JavaScript ES6+ Classes**: Consistent with existing codebase architecture
- **Existing Module System**: Integrate with ModuleManager for proper dependency injection
- **JSON-Based Data**: Skills, synergies, and evolution trees defined in data files
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading for skill trees, caching for synergy calculations

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different skill acquisition methods (gacha, progression, discovery)
- **Observer Pattern**: Skill effects listening to game events through EventManager
- **Factory Pattern**: Skill creation and evolution system
- **Composite Pattern**: Skill synergies combining multiple skills into enhanced effects

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Skill Tree UI**: Interactive skill tree visualization with category tabs
- **Skill Details Modal**: Comprehensive skill information display
- **Synergy Discovery UI**: Visual feedback for discovered skill combinations
- **Evolution Interface**: Skill evolution path selection and requirements display
- **Build Planning Tool**: Loadout manager for active skills with synergy preview

### Backend Services
- **SkillSystem**: Main coordinator integrating with existing systems
- **SkillManager**: Core skill logic, leveling, and validation
- **SynergyCalculator**: Dynamic synergy discovery and effect calculation
- **EvolutionManager**: Skill evolution paths and requirement validation
- **SkillGachaIntegration**: Extends existing GachaSystem for skill acquisition

### Data Models
```javascript
// Extend existing GameState structure
gameState.skills = {
  unlocked: Map<skillId, SkillData>,
  active: Array<skillId>, // Limited by cultivation realm
  synergies: Array<SynergyData>,
  skillPoints: number,
  fragments: Map<skillId, number>,
  masteryLevels: Map<skillId, number>
}
```

### Infrastructure
- **Integration Layer**: SkillIntegration.js following existing system pattern
- **Performance**: Skill effect calculations cached and batched with game loop
- **Save Compatibility**: Skill data included in existing save/migration system

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Core Foundation** (Week 1): Basic skill system, data structures, and state management
2. **Acquisition Systems** (Week 2): Gacha integration and progression unlocks
3. **Advanced Features** (Week 3): Synergies, evolution, and build specialization

### Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Batch skill effect calculations with existing game loop optimization
- **Balance**: Start with conservative skill effects, adjust based on player feedback
- **Complexity**: Implement basic features first, add advanced synergies incrementally
- **Save Compatibility**: Use existing migration system for gradual skill rollout

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Individual skill effects and synergy calculations
- **Integration Tests**: Skill system interaction with cultivation, combat, and gacha
- **Balance Testing**: Automated progression curve validation
- **Performance Tests**: Large skill tree navigation and effect calculation benchmarks

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] Core System: SkillSystem, SkillManager, and data structures
- [ ] Gacha Integration: Extend existing gacha system with skill pools
- [ ] UI Components: Skill tree interface and management screens
- [ ] Synergy System: Dynamic synergy discovery and effect calculation
- [ ] Evolution System: Skill evolution paths and advancement mechanics
- [ ] Cultivation Integration: Realm-gated progression and unlocks
- [ ] Balance & Testing: Progression curves and comprehensive testing
- [ ] Documentation: Player guides and system documentation

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Existing GameState**: Skills data integration
- **EventManager**: Skill events and effect triggers
- **GachaSystem**: Skill acquisition through pulls
- **CultivationSystem**: Realm-based skill unlocks
- **UI Framework**: Existing component system for skill interfaces

### Internal Dependencies
- **Data Files**: Skill definitions and progression trees
- **Validation System**: Skill state validation rules
- **Save System**: Skill data persistence and migration
- **Performance System**: Effect calculation optimization

### Prerequisite Work
- No blocking prerequisites - system designed to integrate with existing architecture
- Optional: UI component enhancements for better skill tree visualization

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Skill Effect Calculation**: < 1ms per skill per game tick
- **Synergy Discovery**: < 10ms for synergy validation check
- **Skill Tree Navigation**: < 16ms frame time for smooth 60fps UI
- **Save/Load**: Skills data adds < 100ms to save/load operations

### Quality Gates
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ coverage for skill system components
- **Integration**: All existing systems continue to function without regression
- **Balance**: Automated validation of skill progression curves
- **Performance**: No frame drops during skill effect calculations

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Player Build Diversity**: At least 6 viable build archetypes achievable
- **Progression Feel**: Clear sense of advancement at each cultivation realm
- **Discovery Experience**: Meaningful synergy discoveries throughout gameplay
- **System Integration**: Seamless interaction with combat, cultivation, and gacha

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline
- **3 weeks** for complete implementation with comprehensive testing
- **Critical path**: Core system → Gacha integration → UI implementation

### Resource Requirements
- **1 developer** full-time focused on system implementation
- **Access to existing codebase** for integration and testing
- **Game balance consultation** for skill effect tuning

### Critical Path Items
1. **Core SkillSystem**: Foundation for all other features
2. **Gacha Integration**: Essential for skill acquisition mechanics
3. **UI Components**: Required for player interaction and testing
4. **Balance Validation**: Critical for system deployment

This epic leverages the existing robust architecture while adding the sophisticated skills system outlined in the PRD. The modular approach ensures clean integration and allows for iterative enhancement of skill features over time.
