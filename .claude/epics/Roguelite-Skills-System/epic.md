# Epic: Roguelite-Skills-System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive skills system that integrates seamlessly with the existing game architecture, providing dynamic progression through cultivation-gated unlocks, gacha acquisition, and build diversity through synergies and evolution. The system leverages existing modular architecture and extends the current gacha and progression systems to create unique player journeys with meaningful choices at every step.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core System Design
- **Modular Architecture**: Follow existing pattern with `SkillSystem.js` as main coordinator and separate managers for different aspects
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Use existing EventManager for skill acquisition, evolution, and synergy discovery events
- **State Management**: Extend GameState with skills section, leveraging existing validation and save systems
- **Data-Driven Configuration**: Use existing data file pattern with `skill-data.js` for skill definitions

### Technology Choices
- **JavaScript ES6+ Classes**: Consistent with existing codebase architecture
- **Existing Module System**: Integrate with ModuleManager for proper dependency injection
- **JSON-Based Data**: Skills, synergies, and evolution trees defined in data files
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading for skill trees, caching for synergy calculations

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different skill acquisition methods (gacha, progression, discovery)
- **Observer Pattern**: Skill effects listening to game events through EventManager
- **Factory Pattern**: Skill creation and evolution system
- **Composite Pattern**: Skill synergies combining multiple skills into enhanced effects

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Skill Tree UI**: Interactive skill tree visualization with category tabs
- **Skill Details Modal**: Comprehensive skill information display
- **Synergy Discovery UI**: Visual feedback for discovered skill combinations
- **Evolution Interface**: Skill evolution path selection and requirements display
- **Build Planning Tool**: Loadout manager for active skills with synergy preview

### Backend Services
- **SkillSystem**: Main coordinator integrating with existing systems
- **SkillManager**: Core skill logic, leveling, and validation
- **SynergyCalculator**: Dynamic synergy discovery and effect calculation
- **EvolutionManager**: Skill evolution paths and requirement validation
- **SkillGachaIntegration**: Extends existing GachaSystem for skill acquisition

### Data Models
```javascript
// Extend existing GameState structure
gameState.skills = {
  unlocked: Map<skillId, SkillData>,
  active: Array<skillId>, // Limited by cultivation realm
  synergies: Array<SynergyData>,
  skillPoints: number,
  fragments: Map<skillId, number>,
  masteryLevels: Map<skillId, number>
}
```

### Infrastructure
- **Integration Layer**: SkillIntegration.js following existing system pattern
- **Performance**: Skill effect calculations cached and batched with game loop
- **Save Compatibility**: Skill data included in existing save/migration system

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Core Foundation** (Week 1): Basic skill system, data structures, and state management
2. **Acquisition Systems** (Week 2): Gacha integration and progression unlocks
3. **Advanced Features** (Week 3): Synergies, evolution, and build specialization

### Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Batch skill effect calculations with existing game loop optimization
- **Balance**: Start with conservative skill effects, adjust based on player feedback
- **Complexity**: Implement basic features first, add advanced synergies incrementally
- **Save Compatibility**: Use existing migration system for gradual skill rollout

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Individual skill effects and synergy calculations
- **Integration Tests**: Skill system interaction with cultivation, combat, and gacha
- **Balance Testing**: Automated progression curve validation
- **Performance Tests**: Large skill tree navigation and effect calculation benchmarks
