# Issue #14 Analysis: Core Skills System Foundation Architecture

## Work Breakdown

This foundation task can be broken into 3 parallel streams:

### Stream A: Core System Classes (Agent-1)
**Files:** `js/systems/SkillSystem.js`, `js/managers/SkillManager.js`
**Work:**
- Create SkillSystem.js coordinator class
- Implement SkillManager.js with core skill logic
- Set up ModuleManager integration
- Create basic skill unlocking/leveling framework

**Estimated time:** 8-12 hours

### Stream B: Data Structures & State (Agent-2)
**Files:** `js/core/GameState.js`, `js/data/skill-data.js`
**Work:**
- Extend GameState with skills object structure
- Create skill-data.js with initial skill definitions
- Implement data validation and migration logic
- Set up save/load compatibility

**Estimated time:** 6-10 hours

### Stream C: Integration & Events (Agent-3)
**Files:** `js/core/EventManager.js`, existing integration points
**Work:**
- Create EventManager integration for skill events
- Set up game loop integration for skill effects
- Implement basic effect calculation framework
- Create skill system initialization logic

**Estimated time:** 8-12 hours

## Dependencies Between Streams
- Stream B (data structures) should start first
- Stream A can begin after Stream B defines the data structure
- Stream C depends on both A and B being partially complete

## Coordination Points
- GameState.skills structure must be defined before SkillManager implementation
- EventManager skill events need coordination with SkillSystem
- All streams converge for final integration testing

## Testing Strategy
- Stream A: Unit tests for SkillSystem/SkillManager classes
- Stream B: Data structure validation and save/load tests
- Stream C: Integration tests with EventManager and game loop
- Final: End-to-end skill acquisition and effect tests

## Success Criteria
- All acceptance criteria met in task #14
- Foundation ready for dependent tasks (#17, #23, #42)
- No regressions in existing game functionality
- Clean integration with existing architecture patterns
