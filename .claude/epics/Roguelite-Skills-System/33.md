# Task: Dynamic Synergy System Skill Combination Discovery

## Description
Implement dynamic synergy discovery system that identifies skill combinations and calculates enhanced effects. The system should provide meaningful synergy discovery moments and create build diversity through skill interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SynergyCalculator class for dynamic synergy detection and calculation
- [ ] Synergy database with skill combination definitions and effects
- [ ] Dynamic synergy discovery during gameplay with visual feedback
- [ ] Synergy effect calculation system integrated with skill effects
- [ ] Synergy progression system allowing synergies to level up
- [ ] UI components for synergy visualization and management

## Technical Details
- Create SynergyCalculator.js with algorithms for detecting skill combinations
- Implement synergy-data.js with synergy definitions including skill requirements and enhanced effects
- Build dynamic discovery system that triggers when players acquire synergy-enabling skills
- Create synergy effect calculation that enhances base skill effects
- Implement synergy mastery system allowing discovered synergies to improve over time
- Add visual feedback components for synergy discovery and active synergies

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Core Skills System Foundation
- [ ] Task 003: Skills UI for synergy visualization components
- [ ] EventManager for synergy discovery events
- [ ] Existing effect calculation systems

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside other features)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] SynergyCalculator implemented and optimized for performance
- [ ] Synergy discovery system working with proper event triggers
- [ ] Synergy effects properly calculated and applied
- [ ] UI feedback for synergy discovery implemented
- [ ] Synergy progression system functional
- [ ] Performance testing passed for synergy calculations
