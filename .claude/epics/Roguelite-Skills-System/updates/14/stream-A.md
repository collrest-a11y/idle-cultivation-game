# Stream A Progress: Core System Classes

## Status: Implementation Complete

## Coordination Notes
- **Dependency**: Created framework that can work with Stream B's GameState.skills structure
- **Strategy**: Implemented complete SkillSystem.js and SkillManager.js with placeholders for Stream B integration

## Completed
- [x] Created updates tracking structure
- [x] Analyzed existing architecture patterns from CultivationSystem and ModuleManager
- [x] Created SkillSystem.js coordinator class following existing patterns
- [x] Created SkillManager.js framework with placeholder GameState.skills support
- [x] Set up ModuleManager integration (registered skills module in main.js)
- [x] Created SkillIntegration.js for proper system lifecycle management
- [x] Implemented basic skill unlocking and leveling framework
- [x] Prepared EventManager integration interfaces

## Implementation Details

### SkillSystem.js
- Coordinator class following CultivationSystem pattern
- Manages skill effects, loadouts, and system coordination
- Event-driven architecture with proper lifecycle management
- Statistics tracking and performance monitoring
- Integration with other game systems via events

### SkillManager.js
- Core skill logic and state management
- Skill unlocking, leveling, and validation framework
- Loadout management with configurable size limits
- Change detection and caching for performance
- Placeholder structure for GameState.skills integration

### SkillIntegration.js
- Lifecycle management for skill systems
- Module registration and dependency injection
- Event handling for cross-system integration
- Error handling and graceful degradation

### ModuleManager Integration
- Registered skills module in main.js
- Proper dependency ordering (depends on cultivation)
- Game loop integration for updates
- Shutdown handling

## Ready for Stream B Integration
- SkillManager uses placeholder GameState.skills structure
- All methods prepared to work with actual data structure
- Validation and cost checking frameworks in place
- State management ready for real implementation

## Next Steps for Other Streams
- Stream B: Define GameState.skills structure and skill-data.js
- Stream C: Integrate with EventManager and game loop effects
- Final integration testing once all streams complete

## Architecture Decisions
- Followed existing system patterns from CultivationSystem.js
- Used dependency injection via ModuleManager
- Implemented EventManager integration following existing patterns
- Created placeholder skill definitions for testing
- Designed for easy completion once data structures are defined
