# Task: Add State Validation & Recovery

## Description
Validate save data before loading to prevent corruption-related blank pages. Provide recovery options for corrupted states and add backward compatibility layer for older save formats. Implement comprehensive data integrity checks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Save data validation before loading attempts
- [ ] Schema version checking and migration support
- [ ] Recovery options for corrupted save states
- [ ] Backup save creation before risky operations
- [ ] User-friendly recovery UI for data corruption
- [ ] Automatic fallback to default state when recovery fails

## Technical Details
Implementation approach centers on robust save data validation and recovery mechanisms.

- Files to modify:
  - src/managers/SaveManager.js
  - src/core/GameState.js
  - src/validation/SaveValidator.js (new)
  - src/ui/RecoveryModal.js (new)
- Key changes:
  - Add JSON schema validation for save data
  - Implement save data migration system
  - Create recovery UI for user interaction
  - Add automated backup system

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 105 (Module Loading) - Need stable module loading before state validation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-5 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
