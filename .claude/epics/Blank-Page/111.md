# Task: End-to-End Testing & Documentation

## Description
Comprehensive testing of all loading scenarios and creation of troubleshooting documentation. This task validates that the game loads successfully under all conditions and provides clear documentation for any remaining edge cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Game loads successfully from file:// protocol
- [ ] Game loads successfully from http://localhost
- [ ] Game loads successfully from production URL
- [ ] Game recovers from corrupted localStorage
- [ ] Game handles missing/blocked assets gracefully
- [ ] Character creation works 100% of the time
- [ ] Safe mode triggers appropriately on failures
- [ ] All error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers common issues
- [ ] Performance meets targets (<5 second load)

## Technical Details
### Testing Scenarios
- **File Protocol Testing**
  - Direct file:// access in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  - Test with various security settings

- **Corruption Testing**
  - Inject bad data into localStorage
  - Delete required game files
  - Simulate network failures

- **Performance Testing**
  - Measure load times on various devices
  - Profile memory usage
  - Check for memory leaks

- **Browser Compatibility**
  - Chrome/Edge (last 2 versions)
  - Firefox (last 2 versions)
  - Safari (last 2 versions)
  - Mobile browsers

### Documentation Creation
- **Files to create/update:**

- [ ] Task 106: Character creation must work
- [ ] Task 107: State validation must be complete
- [ ] Task 108: Safe mode must be implemented
- [ ] Task 109: Health dashboard for debugging
- [ ] Task 110: Progressive loading must work

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] No uncaught exceptions in any scenario
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Test automation scripts created
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Validated on production
