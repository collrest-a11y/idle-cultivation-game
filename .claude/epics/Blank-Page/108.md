# Task: Create Safe Mode

## Description
Implement minimal game mode that activates when normal initialization fails. Provides basic UI with core gameplay only, automatically triggered after multiple initialization failures. Ensures players can always access essential game functions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Safe mode triggers after 3 consecutive initialization failures
- [ ] Minimal UI loads with core gameplay elements only
- [ ] Basic save/load functionality available in safe mode
- [ ] Clear indication to user that safe mode is active
- [ ] Option to attempt normal mode restart from safe mode
- [ ] Essential game progression still possible

## Technical Details
Implementation approach creates a lightweight fallback system with minimal dependencies.

- Files to modify:
  - src/core/SafeMode.js (new)
  - src/ui/SafeModeUI.js (new)
  - src/core/GameInitializer.js
  - src/managers/ModuleManager.js
- Key changes:
  - Create safe mode initialization pipeline
  - Build minimal UI with essential features only
  - Add failure counter and trigger logic
  - Implement safe mode state management

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 105 (Module Loading) - Need stable module loading foundation
- [ ] Task 107 (State Validation) - Need save validation for safe mode

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-5 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
