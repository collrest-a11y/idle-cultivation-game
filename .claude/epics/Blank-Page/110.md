# Task: Implement Progressive Loading

## Description
Load critical systems first (GameState, SaveManager) for core functionality, then UI systems for user visibility, and finally enhancement modules. This ensures users see progress and core game remains functional even if advanced features fail to load.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Critical systems load first (GameState, SaveManager)
- [ ] UI systems load second for immediate user feedback
- [ ] Enhancement modules load last without blocking core game
- [ ] Visual progress indicators for each loading phase
- [ ] Game remains playable if non-critical modules fail
- [ ] Graceful degradation when optional features don't load

## Technical Details
Implementation approach uses phased loading with priority-based module initialization.

- Files to modify:
  - src/core/ProgressiveLoader.js (new)
  - src/core/GameInitializer.js
  - src/modules/ModuleManager.js
  - src/ui/LoadingProgress.js
- Key changes:
  - Create three-phase loading system
  - Implement module priority classification
  - Add visual progress tracking
  - Build graceful fallback for failed optional modules

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 105 (Module Loading) - Need foundation module loading system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-5 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
