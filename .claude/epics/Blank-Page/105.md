# Task: Fix Module Loading Order

## Description
Ensure modules load in correct dependency order to prevent blank page issues. Add robust error handling with try-catch and retry logic to ModuleManager. Implement timeout protection for hanging operations that could cause indefinite loading states.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Modules load in correct dependency order (GameState → SaveManager → UI → Modules)
- [ ] Try-catch blocks wrap all module initialization
- [ ] Retry logic attempts failed module loads up to 3 times
- [ ] Timeout protection prevents operations from hanging indefinitely
- [ ] Clear error messages for each failure type
- [ ] Loading progress indicators for each module stage

## Technical Details
Implementation approach focuses on enhancing the ModuleManager with dependency tracking and fault tolerance.

- Files to modify:
  - src/modules/ModuleManager.js
  - src/core/GameState.js
  - src/managers/SaveManager.js
- Key changes:
  - Add dependency graph to ModuleManager
  - Implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Add timeout wrappers for all async operations
  - Create loading state tracking system

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 104 (Loading Screen) - Need visual feedback during module loading

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-5 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
