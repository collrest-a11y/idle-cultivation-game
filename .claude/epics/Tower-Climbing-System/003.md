# Task: Core Climbing Mechanics

## Description
Implement the fundamental climbing logic including basic progression mechanics, difficulty scaling, and reward calculations for a single tower type. This establishes the core gameplay loop that will be extended for multiple tower types.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Basic climbing progression logic implemented
- [ ] Difficulty scaling formula for higher floors
- [ ] Core reward calculation system
- [ ] Floor advancement mechanics
- [ ] Basic challenge resolution (simple pass/fail)
- [ ] Integration with player stats and progression
- [ ] Climbing speed calculations based on player power

## Technical Details
- Implement TowerEngine core climbing algorithms
- Create RewardCalculator with scalable formulas
- Floor difficulty progression based on exponential scaling
- Integration with cultivation system for power calculations
- Event-driven progression updates
- Caching system for performance optimization

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Tower Module Infrastructure
- [ ] Existing cultivation system for power calculations
- [ ] Combat system for challenge resolution

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true (can work alongside UI development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Climbing mechanics fully functional
- [ ] Difficulty scaling balanced and tested
- [ ] Reward calculations verified for balance
- [ ] Performance optimized for continuous climbing
- [ ] Integration tests with cultivation system passing
- [ ] Unit tests covering all climbing scenarios
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
