# Task: Auto-Climbing System

## Description
Implement the automated climbing system that allows players to progress through towers without active input. This includes configurable strategies, stop conditions, and intelligent automation that respects player preferences and game balance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Auto-climbing toggle and basic automation
- [ ] Configurable climbing strategies (speed vs safety)
- [ ] Stop conditions (health, resources, specific floors)
- [ ] Auto-climbing settings UI
- [ ] Intelligent floor skipping for completed content
- [ ] Integration with prestige system for automated resets
- [ ] Performance optimization for continuous automation

## Technical Details
- Implement AutoClimbSystem with strategy patterns
- Create configurable automation rules and conditions
- Efficient climbing loops with proper performance management
- UI controls for automation settings and preferences
- Integration with tower mechanics and prestige system
- Background processing for idle automation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Core Climbing Mechanics
- [ ] Task 004: Multi-Tower Type System
- [ ] Existing idle game loop infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true (builds on existing climbing mechanics)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Auto-climbing system fully functional
- [ ] Strategy configuration working correctly
- [ ] Stop conditions respected and tested
- [ ] Performance optimized for continuous operation
- [ ] UI controls intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Integration with existing systems verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
