# Task: Performance Optimization

## Description
Optimize the tower system for high-performance operation at extreme scales, ensuring smooth gameplay even when players reach floors in the tens of thousands. This includes calculation caching, memory management, and efficient algorithms for large-scale operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Smooth operation up to floor 100,000+ with <50ms response time
- [ ] Efficient calculation caching for high floor numbers
- [ ] Memory usage optimization preventing leaks
- [ ] Background calculation optimization for auto-climbing
- [ ] UI responsiveness maintained during intensive operations
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Scalable data structures for extreme progression

## Technical Details
- Implement calculation caching with intelligent invalidation
- Optimize algorithms for large number operations
- Memory pooling and efficient data structure usage
- Background processing optimization for auto-climbing
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Lazy loading and pagination for large datasets

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 007: Auto-Climbing System
- [ ] Task 008: Cross-System Integration
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools and frameworks

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16
- Parallel: true (optimization work)
