# Task: Cross-System Integration

## Description
Establish comprehensive integration between the tower system and all existing game systems including cultivation, combat, skills, and resources. This ensures tower climbing feels like a natural part of the overall game progression rather than an isolated feature.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cultivation system integration for realm requirements and bonuses
- [ ] Combat system integration for CP calculations and challenges
- [ ] Skill system integration for skill-based rewards and progression
- [ ] Resource economy integration with spirit crystals, jade, and shards
- [ ] Achievement system integration for tower-specific achievements
- [ ] Two-way progression bonuses between systems
- [ ] Balanced resource flow to maintain game economy

## Technical Details
- Integration interfaces between tower and cultivation systems
- Combat power calculations affecting tower progression
- Skill system rewards and evolution material distribution
- Resource generation and consumption balancing
- Achievement triggers and progression tracking
- Cross-system bonus calculations and applications

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: Multi-Tower Type System
- [ ] Task 006: Prestige System Implementation
- [ ] All existing game systems (cultivation, combat, skills, resources)
- [ ] Achievement system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 18-22
- Parallel: true (integration work with clear boundaries)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All system integrations working correctly
- [ ] Resource flows balanced and tested
- [ ] Cross-system bonuses calculated properly
- [ ] Achievement integration functional
- [ ] No negative impact on existing system performance
- [ ] Integration tests passing for all connected systems
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
