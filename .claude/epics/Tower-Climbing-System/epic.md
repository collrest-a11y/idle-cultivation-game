# Epic: Tower-Climbing-System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive tower climbing system that provides infinite vertical progression with incremental rewards, multiple tower types, and prestige mechanics. The system integrates seamlessly with existing cultivation, combat, and progression systems while introducing new idle gameplay mechanics focused on automated climbing and strategic optimization.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Module-based Architecture**: Integrate with existing ModuleManager system as a new "tower" module
- **Event-Driven Design**: Use EventManager for cross-system communication and UI updates
- **Data Persistence**: Leverage existing SaveManager and GameState for tower progress and prestige data
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement efficient calculation caching for high floor numbers
- **Extensible Tower Types**: Abstract tower system allowing easy addition of new tower varieties

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Tower UI System**: New view component integrated with existing UI framework
- **Tower Selection Interface**: Grid-based tower type selection with unlock requirements
- **Progress Visualization**: Real-time climbing progress with floor counters and reward previews
- **Prestige Interface**: Dedicated UI for prestige mechanics and permanent bonuses
- **Auto-Climb Controls**: Settings panel for automation strategies and stop conditions

### Backend Services
- **Tower Engine**: Core climbing logic with difficulty scaling and reward calculations
- **Reward System**: Incremental reward formulas with milestone bonuses and anti-inflation measures
- **Prestige Manager**: Handles reset mechanics and permanent bonus accumulation
- **Auto-Climb System**: Intelligent automation with customizable strategies
- **Challenge Generator**: Dynamic floor generation based on tower type and difficulty

### Infrastructure
- **Tower Data Models**: Structured data definitions for towers, floors, and rewards
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track calculation efficiency for high floor numbers
- **Balance Validation**: Built-in checks for reward economy and progression curves
- **Integration Points**: Clean interfaces with cultivation, combat, and skill systems

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
- Implement basic tower module structure and data models
- Create tower selection UI and basic climbing interface
- Establish core climbing mechanics for single tower type
- Integrate with existing save/load system

### Phase 2: Multiple Tower Types
- Implement all five main tower types with unique mechanics
- Add tower-specific reward systems and scaling formulas
- Create specialized floor types and challenges
- Implement milestone and special floor rewards

### Phase 3: Prestige & Automation
- Add prestige system with reset mechanics and permanent bonuses
- Implement auto-climbing system with strategy selection
- Create prestige UI and progression visualization
- Add floor skipping and time acceleration features

### Phase 4: Special Events & Polish
- Implement rotating event towers and seasonal content
- Add VIP exclusive towers and enhanced rewards
- Performance optimization for extreme floor numbers
- Balance testing and progression curve refinement

## Implementation Issues

Detailed breakdown available in: `.claude/epics/Tower-Climbing-System/issues.md`

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (5-8 days)
- **Issue #1**: Tower Module Infrastructure - Core structure and data models
- **Issue #2**: Basic Tower UI System - Selection interface and climbing view
- **Issue #3**: Core Climbing Mechanics - Basic progression and rewards

### Phase 2: Multiple Tower Types (5-7 days)
- **Issue #4**: Multi-Tower Type System - All five tower types with unique mechanics
- **Issue #5**: Specialized Floor Types - Boss floors, milestones, and events

### Phase 3: Prestige & Automation (5-7 days)
- **Issue #6**: Prestige System Implementation - Reset mechanics and permanent bonuses
- **Issue #7**: Auto-Climbing System - Automation with configurable strategies

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (7-10 days)
- **Issue #8**: Cross-System Integration - Cultivation, combat, and skill system connections
- **Issue #9**: Performance Optimization - High floor calculation efficiency
- **Issue #10**: Special Content & Events - VIP towers and seasonal content

## Dependencies
- **Existing Core Systems**: EventManager, GameState, SaveManager, ModuleManager
- **Cultivation System**: For realm requirements and cultivation-based rewards
- **Combat System**: For combat-based tower challenges and CP calculations
- **Skill System**: For skill-based rewards and evolution materials
- **UI Framework**: Existing component system for tower interfaces

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- **Performance**: Smooth operation up to floor 10,000+ with <100ms calculation time
- **Memory Efficiency**: Tower data structures scale efficiently without memory leaks
- **Save Compatibility**: Full persistence of tower progress and prestige data
- **Cross-System Integration**: Seamless interaction with all existing game systems
- **Balance Validation**: Reward curves provide meaningful progression without breaking economy
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces with responsive feedback and clear progression indicators

## Estimated Effort
- **Overall Timeline**: 3-4 weeks for complete implementation
- **Critical Path**: Core tower mechanics → Multi-tower system → Prestige system → Auto-climbing
- **Resource Requirements**: Focus on modular implementation to leverage existing systems
- **Key Risks**: Balancing reward formulas and ensuring performance at extreme scales

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Requirements
- Support calculations for floors up to 100,000+
- Maintain <50ms response time for climbing actions
- Efficient memory usage with data structure optimization
- Smooth UI updates during auto-climbing sequences

### Integration Points
- **Cultivation System**: Realm requirements, breakthrough materials, cultivation speed bonuses
- **Combat System**: CP requirements, combat skill rewards, enemy generation
- **Skill System**: Skill book rewards, evolution materials, mastery bonuses
- **Resource Economy**: Spirit crystals, jade, shards integration with existing balance
- **Achievement System**: Tower-specific achievements and milestone tracking

### Data Models
```typescript
// Core tower data structures
TowerSystem: Multiple tower types with unique mechanics
TowerProgress: Per-tower climbing progress and statistics
PrestigeData: Permanent bonuses and prestige levels
AutoClimbConfig: Automation settings and strategies
RewardCalculator: Scalable reward formulas with caching
```

This epic provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing a feature-rich tower climbing system that enhances the idle cultivation game with meaningful vertical progression while maintaining integration with all existing systems.
