# Task: Tower Module Infrastructure

## Description
Implement the core tower module structure and data models that will serve as the foundation for the entire tower climbing system. This includes integrating with the existing ModuleManager system, creating essential data structures, and establishing the basic framework for tower functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tower module integrated with existing ModuleManager system
- [ ] Core tower data models defined and implemented
- [ ] Basic tower types enumeration and structure created
- [ ] Tower progress tracking data structures implemented
- [ ] Integration with existing EventManager for cross-system communication
- [ ] Save/load compatibility with existing SaveManager
- [ ] Basic tower initialization and cleanup methods

## Technical Details
- Create new tower module in existing module architecture
- Implement TowerSystem, TowerProgress, and core data structures
- Define tower type enums and basic properties
- Establish event patterns for tower state changes
- Integration points with GameState for persistence
- Module registration and lifecycle management

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing ModuleManager system
- [ ] EventManager for cross-system communication
- [ ] SaveManager for data persistence
- [ ] GameState for state management

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16
- Parallel: true (foundational work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and follows project standards
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing for all data models
- [ ] Integration tests with existing systems passing
- [ ] Module properly registers with ModuleManager
- [ ] Save/load functionality verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
