# Task: Multi-Tower Type System

## Description
Implement all five main tower types (Strength, Agility, Cultivation, Skill, Mixed) with their unique mechanics, challenge types, and reward systems. Each tower type should offer distinct gameplay experiences while maintaining balance across the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All five tower types implemented with unique mechanics
- [ ] Tower-specific challenge generation systems
- [ ] Unique reward formulas for each tower type
- [ ] Tower unlock requirements and progression gates
- [ ] Balanced scaling across all tower types
- [ ] Tower-specific UI elements and visual indicators
- [ ] Cross-tower progression tracking

## Technical Details
- Extend tower system to support multiple tower types
- Implement tower-specific challenge generators
- Create distinct reward calculators for each type
- Tower unlock logic based on player progression
- Performance optimization for multiple active towers
- Data structures for tracking progress across all towers

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Tower Module Infrastructure
- [ ] Task 003: Core Climbing Mechanics
- [ ] Cultivation system for realm-based unlocks
- [ ] Skill system for skill-based towers

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 20-24
- Parallel: false (builds on core mechanics)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tower types fully implemented and functional
- [ ] Unique mechanics tested and balanced
- [ ] Reward systems verified for each type
- [ ] Unlock progression working correctly
- [ ] Performance maintained across multiple towers
- [ ] Comprehensive tests covering all tower types
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
