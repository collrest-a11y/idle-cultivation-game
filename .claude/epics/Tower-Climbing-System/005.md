# Task: Specialized Floor Types

## Description
Implement specialized floor types including boss floors, milestone floors, treasure floors, and event floors. These provide variety and special rewards to break up the standard climbing progression and create memorable moments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Boss floors with enhanced challenges and rewards
- [ ] Milestone floors at significant intervals (every 100 floors)
- [ ] Treasure floors with rare reward opportunities
- [ ] Event floors with time-limited special mechanics
- [ ] Special floor generation algorithms
- [ ] Enhanced reward systems for special floors
- [ ] Visual indicators for special floor types

## Technical Details
- Implement specialized floor generation logic
- Create enhanced challenge systems for boss floors
- Special reward calculators for milestone and treasure floors
- Event floor mechanics with rotating content
- Visual and audio cues for special floor encounters
- Performance optimization for special floor calculations

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: Multi-Tower Type System
- [ ] Existing audio/visual systems for special effects
- [ ] Event system for time-limited content

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: true (extends existing tower mechanics)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All special floor types implemented and functional
- [ ] Special floor generation working correctly
- [ ] Enhanced rewards balanced and tested
- [ ] Visual indicators clear and informative
- [ ] Performance impact minimized
- [ ] Tests covering all special floor scenarios
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
