# Production Rollback Procedures
## Idle Cultivation Game - Emergency Recovery Protocols

### Emergency Rollback Plan Overview

#### Rollback Scenarios
- **Critical System Failure**: One or more of the 24 integrated systems failing
- **Performance Degradation**: Performance below acceptable thresholds
- **Data Corruption**: User data integrity compromised
- **Security Breach**: Security vulnerabilities exploited
- **Deployment Issues**: Failed deployment causing system instability

#### Rollback Time Targets
- **Emergency Rollback**: <15 minutes for critical issues
- **Standard Rollback**: <30 minutes for performance issues
- **Full System Rollback**: <60 minutes for complete system restoration

## Database Rollback Procedures

### Database Backup Strategy

#### Pre-Deployment Backup Checklist
- [ ] **Full Database Backup**
  - [ ] Complete database dump created
  - [ ] Backup integrity verified
  - [ ] Backup size and completion time recorded
  - [ ] Backup stored in secure, accessible location

- [ ] **Incremental Backup Points**
  - [ ] Transaction log backup created
  - [ ] Point-in-time recovery enabled
  - [ ] Backup retention policy applied
  - [ ] Recovery test performed

### Database Rollback Execution

#### Step 1: Immediate Database Protection
```bash
# Stop application connections
systemctl stop idle-cultivation-game

# Create emergency backup before rollback
pg_dump -h localhost -U gameuser idle_cultivation_db > emergency_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup integrity
pg_restore --list emergency_backup_*.sql | head -20
```

#### Step 2: Database Restoration
```bash
# Drop current database (CRITICAL - ENSURE BACKUP FIRST)
dropdb -h localhost -U postgres idle_cultivation_db

# Recreate database
createdb -h localhost -U postgres idle_cultivation_db

# Restore from backup
pg_restore -h localhost -U gameuser -d idle_cultivation_db backup_before_deployment.sql

# Verify restoration
psql -h localhost -U gameuser -d idle_cultivation_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;"
```

#### Step 3: Data Integrity Validation
```sql
-- Validate player data integrity
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_players,
  COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) as unique_players,
  AVG(level) as avg_level,
  MAX(created_at) as latest_player
FROM players;

-- Validate system data
SELECT system_name, COUNT(*) as records
FROM system_data
GROUP BY system_name
ORDER BY system_name;

-- Check for data consistency
SELECT
  'Characters' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM characters
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Equipment', COUNT(*) FROM equipment
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Progression', COUNT(*) FROM cp_progression;
```

### Database Migration Rollback

#### Schema Rollback Scripts
```sql
-- Rollback schema changes for 24 integrated systems
-- MMORPG Systems rollback
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS new_combat_logs CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS new_equipment_stats CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE characters DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS new_stat_column;

-- CP Progression Systems rollback
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mount_upgrades CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS wing_enhancements CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE cp_progression DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS new_progression_type;

-- Core Systems rollback
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_power_calculator_new;
ALTER TABLE game_state DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS new_state_field;
```

## Configuration Rollback

### Application Configuration Rollback

#### Configuration File Restoration
```bash
# Backup current configuration
cp -r /app/config /app/config_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Restore previous configuration
cp -r /app/config_backup_previous/* /app/config/

# Verify configuration integrity
node /app/scripts/validate-config.js

# Restart application with previous config
systemctl restart idle-cultivation-game
```

#### Environment Variable Rollback
```bash
# Restore previous environment variables
cp /app/.env.backup /app/.env

# Reload environment
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart idle-cultivation-game

# Verify environment loading
node -e "console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV, process.env.DB_HOST)"
```

### System Configuration Rollback

#### Web Server Configuration
```bash
# Nginx configuration rollback
cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/idle-cultivation-game.backup /etc/nginx/sites-available/idle-cultivation-game
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx

# SSL certificate rollback (if needed)
cp /etc/ssl/certs/previous/* /etc/ssl/certs/
systemctl restart nginx
```

#### Load Balancer Configuration
```bash
# HAProxy configuration rollback
cp /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.backup /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
systemctl restart haproxy

# Verify load balancer health
curl -I http://loadbalancer.local/health
```

---

## Application Code Rollback

### Git-Based Code Rollback

#### Quick Rollback to Previous Commit
```bash
# Identify current and previous commits
git log --oneline -10

# Create rollback branch
git checkout -b emergency-rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Rollback to previous stable commit
git reset --hard [PREVIOUS_STABLE_COMMIT_HASH]

# Force push to production branch (DANGEROUS - use with caution)
git push origin master --force-with-lease
```

#### Deployment Artifact Rollback
```bash
# List available deployment artifacts
ls -la /app/deployments/

# Stop current application
systemctl stop idle-cultivation-game

# Switch to previous deployment
ln -sfn /app/deployments/previous /app/current

# Restart application
systemctl start idle-cultivation-game

# Verify application health
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Container-Based Rollback (if using Docker)

#### Container Image Rollback
```bash
# List recent images
docker images idle-cultivation-game

# Stop current container
docker stop idle-cultivation-game-prod

# Start previous image
docker run -d --name idle-cultivation-game-prod-rollback \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  idle-cultivation-game:previous-stable

# Switch traffic to rollback container
# (Update load balancer configuration)
```
