## 🎛️ Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-Time Monitoring Coverage
- **Performance Metrics**: Frame rate (60fps), API response (<5ms), memory (45-65MB), CPU (8-15%)
- **System Health**: All 24 systems with individual health scores
- **User Experience**: Session tracking, error rates, feature usage
- **Infrastructure**: Server resources, database performance, network connectivity

### Alert Levels and Response
- **🔴 Critical**: Immediate response required (system down, data corruption, security breach)
- **🟡 Warning**: Monitor closely (performance degradation, high error rates)
- **🟢 Info**: Trending information (usage patterns, performance variations)

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Real-time health monitoring
./production/scripts/health-check.sh continuous

# Performance monitoring
npm run test:performance:continuous

# System status dashboard
npm run monitoring:dashboard

# Generate health report
./production/scripts/health-check.sh status
```

## 🔄 Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Triggers (Immediate Action Required)
- System completely unresponsive for >5 minutes
- Data corruption affecting >10% of users
- Security breach confirmed
- Frame rate drops below 30fps for >10 minutes
- API response time >20ms for >10 minutes

### Emergency Rollback Execution
```bash
# Emergency rollback (requires confirmation)
./production/scripts/emergency-rollback.sh

# Force rollback (automated scenarios)
./production/scripts/emergency-rollback.sh --force
```

### Rollback Time Targets
- **Emergency Rollback**: <15 minutes for critical issues
- **Standard Rollback**: <30 minutes for performance issues
- **Full System Rollback**: <60 minutes for complete restoration
