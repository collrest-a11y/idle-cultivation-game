   - [ ] Monitor system response to changes
   - [ ] Verify issue resolution

### Rollback Decision Tree

```
Issue Detected
      ↓
Is system completely down? ──→ YES ──→ IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK
      ↓ NO
Is data at risk? ──→ YES ──→ IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK
      ↓ NO
Is performance <50% of target? ──→ YES ──→ ESCALATE TO DEPLOYMENT LEAD
      ↓ NO
Is workaround available? ──→ YES ──→ IMPLEMENT WORKAROUND
      ↓ NO
Can fix be implemented quickly? ──→ YES ──→ IMPLEMENT FIX
      ↓ NO
ESCALATE TO DEPLOYMENT LEAD ──→ ROLLBACK DECISION
```
